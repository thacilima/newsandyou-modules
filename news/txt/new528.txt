Oasis members reunite for charity album
The drummers and bassists behind many classic bands’ rhythm sections have reunited for a charity album. Zak Starkey, who drummed with Oasis on their final two albums ‘Don’t Belive The Truth’ and ‘Dig Out Your Soul’, has formed the band Sshh with singer Sshh Liguz. Their album ‘Issues’ sees the rhythm sections of many musicians play together to back the duo as they cover a host of classic songs. These include Amy Winehouse’s bassist Dale Davis and drummer Nathan Allen play on a cover of ‘Back To Black’, while Starkey’s former Oasis bandmate Gem Archer plays guitar on a cover of The Small Faces’ 1966 song ‘Tin Soldier’, alongside their drummer Kenny Jones and The Sex Pistols bassist Glen Matlock. The album’s first single ‘Problems’ is a cover of The Sex Pistols featuring Matlock and Pistols drummer Paul Cook. ‘Issues’, out later this year, also features members of Primal Scream, Marilyn Manson, Blondie, The Pretenders, Mott The Hoople and The Ruts. Starkey, who now plays with The Who, said he learnt more about playing drums from Jones than anyone else in his career – including his father, The Beatles drummer Ringo Starr. Starkey told NME: “Of all the people who’ve taught me drums – Keith Moon, my dad, all of them – Kenney showed me the most. It was just great to play with him. Two Who drummers, past and present, playing at the same time: just one more unprecedented connection in the making of this album.” Sshh made their live debut at London club The Box this week, watched on by Starr, Klaxons guitarist Jamie Reynolds, Ride guitarist Andy Bell, Adam And The Ants guitarist Marco Pirroni, The Lightning Seeds singer Ian Broudie and producer Youth. Profits from ‘Issues’ go to Teenage Cancer Trust.
