The Killers have started recording their fifth album
The Killers have begun recording their fifth studio album. The Las Vegas band started sessions in their hometown yesterday (September 9). Drummer Ronnie Vannucci Jr. told DIY on Wednesday (September 7): “We go into the studio two days from now. On the ninth [September], we start on the ninth.” He continued: “We’ll see what happens. We’ve been working with different people and seeing how it feels, and we’re starting to work with another person now. I don’t know if we wanna reveal who that is.” The drummer said he expected the sessions to be “surprising” because “when we get in [the studio] we come at it from one direction, and then it’ll go another direction”. Vannucci Jr. also addressed rumours about the group working with Elton John. “I think that’s what they are – just rumours. “I think that came from his radio show. “First of all it would be great to work with Elton John,” he said. “But we haven’t done anything beside the Christmas song [‘Joseph, Better You Than Me’] with him. That would be awesome to work with him, especially in a songwriting capacity… that dude is no joke when it comes to writing songs. That would be fun, but that is just a rumour. A nice rumour, I suppose!” The album will be the band’s first since 2012’s ‘‘. https://link.brightcove.com/services/player/?bctid=4533512941001
