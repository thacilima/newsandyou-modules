Britney Spears doesn’t listen to her own music
Britney Spears has admitted she doesn’t listen to her own music. The singer revealed she considers her involvement with her recorded music ends once she’s finished recording her songs. Spears told Flaunt: “I don’t really listen to my music. My kids and my nieces do. I’m about the creative process – I’m in the moment of being creative, and then I put it out there.” Spears is in the middle of a residency at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas, and said: “Of course, I sing my songs every night and I have to listen to it that way, but I’m all about change. But there’s a part of me in my music, and I hope that my fans can have that part of me when they hear me on the radio, buy my CD or whatever they do.” The singer plays her first UK show for five years when she headlines London’s Roundhouse on September 27 as part of Apple Music Festival. She explained that she suffers from anxiety issues when she’s in public away from her concerts. Spears said: “I’m so weird. I get nervous in a lot of situations: parties, clubs… When there are a lot of people around, I’m a weird, anxiety-ridden person.” Spears’ new album ‘Glory’ became her fifth to reach No 2, when it was beaten by [b]Barbra Streisand[/s]’s ‘Encores’ last week.
