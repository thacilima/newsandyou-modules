Drumming legend dies
Mike Gibbins, drummer with Badfinger, has died aged 56, it has been announced. The 1960s rockers were formed in Wales and signed to The Beatles’ Apple Corps label. But they were best known for writing ‘Without You’, which became massive hit for both Harry Nillson and Mariah Carey. Gibbins died on Tuesday (October 4) at his home in Florida. A statement on his website today reads: “To all Mike’s fans, it is with deepest regret to inform all that he passed away on 4 October, in his sleep by natural causes. He will be terribly missed by all.” Badfinger were plagued by tragedy throughout their career, with both main songwriters in the band Pete Ham and Tom Evans committing suicide due to financial difficulties endured by the band. Badfinger biographer Dan Matovina told the BBC: “Badfinger was the highlight of his life, coming out of Wales, having success, touring America. But the tragedy of losing his two bandmates to suicides weighed heavily on that.” Beatles drummer Ringo Starr was said to a great admirer of Gibbins’ style.
