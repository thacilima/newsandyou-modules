President Barack Obama to hold mini SXSW festival at the White House
President Barack Obama will hold a one-day festival in the grounds of the White House next month. The President and his wife Michelle Obama both spoke at SXSW Festival in Austin, Texas back in March, with the First Lady delivering the keynote speech. Inspired by the festival, the Obama administration will now hold their own version on October 3, in collaboration with SXSW. Called ‘South by South Lawn’, the event will provide a similar experience to SXSW in showcasing music, film and discussions. As NPR reports, an official White House statement explained that the event “will bring together creators, innovators, and organisers who work day in and day out to improve the lives of their fellow Americans and people around the world.” The White House website is accepting nominations from the general public about who they’d like to see perform and appear at the event, which you can visit here. Back in May, the President surprisingly praised the Finnish metal scene. During a speech about the virtues of Finland, President Obama commented on the country’s love of metal and, in fact, his own. “I do want to point out, that Finland has perhaps the most heavy metal bands in the world, per capita, and also ranks high on good governance,” he said. “I don’t know that there’s any correlation there.”
