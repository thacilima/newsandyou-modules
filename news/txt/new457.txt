Frank Ocean has already made $1 million from ‘Blonde’, says report
Frank Ocean has already made $1m (£750,000) from ‘Blonde’, a new report from US business magazine Forbes estimates. The report explains that Ocean’s yield from the album is especially high because he released it on his own indie label, Boys Don’t Cry, after fulfilling his contractual obligations to majors Def Jam and Universal by putting out visual album ‘Endless’ beforehand. Had he released ‘Blonde’ on a major, Forbes estimates, he would only have pocketed around $550,000 (£415,000) from the album so far, and some of that would have been claimed back by the label if they had given Ocean an advance. Sources told Forbes that Ocean could be receiving anywhere between $5 and $7.50 (£3.80 and £5.30) for each copy of ‘Blonde’ shared on iTunes for $9.99 (£7.50), whereas an artist on a major could expect to receive somewhere between $1.50 and $2.00 (£1.10 and £1.50) per copy.

Ocean finally released his second studio album ‘Blonde’ on August 20, over four years since the arrival of his highly acclaimed debut, ‘channel ORANGE’. ‘Blonde’ has since topped the album charts in both the UK and US. One of Ocean’s collaborators, keyboardist Buddy Ross, has recently spoken about the high level of mystery surrounding the ‘Blonde’ and ‘Endless’ projects.
