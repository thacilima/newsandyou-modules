The Charlatans album update
The Charlatans are close to completing their forthcoming studio album ‘Simpatico’. The band spent three weeks mixing the LP at the beginning of the autumn at London‘s Townhouse studios with producer Jim Lowe after completing recording sessions at Hook End Manor studios in Oxfordshire. Bassist Martin Blunt wrote on the band’s official website that the five-piece will be “reconvening in November to compile the album and to finish off exclusive tracks for forthcoming singles.” He also said that The Charlatans will be revealing dates for a New Year tour, a new track download, album and single releases in December. As previously reported on NME.COM, tracks slated to appear on the record include ‘For Your Entertainment’, ‘N.Y.C. (There’s No Need To Stop’), ‘The City Of The Dead’ and ‘For All Others’. Blunt also revealed that three new tracks – ‘Always A Clue In A Dead Man’s Eye’, ‘Blackened Blue Eyes’ and ‘The Road To Paradise’ – are all set to feature on the LP.
