Kings Of Leon call US Presidential race ‘a fucking trainwreck’
Kings Of Leon have admitted they’re in despair over choosing who to vote for in the forthcoming US Presidential election. Singer Caleb Followill has revealed that he doesn’t want to choose between Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton or Republican rival Donald Trump. In the new NME, available nationwide today, Followill said: “The race is a fucking trainwreck. Everything that’s happening in America is a trainwreck, but anything that’s happening right now in terms of politics is kinda scary.” Followill is certain that Trump will win in the band’s home state of Tennessee. He said: “Donald Trump is going to win Tennessee because Tennessee is a Republican state, so it doesn’t matter what you do or who you vote for. But it’s definitely a very funny situation going on.” Admitting that he wasn’t convinced by Clinton, Followill continued: “I’m a voter and I vote, and this is the first time I feel like I don’t know if I can vote. Nothing that either party is showing is, I feel, going to be good for my child or my future. It’s fucking hilarious. It’s fun to watch, though.” Kings Of Leon release new album ‘WALLS’ on October 14, having shared new single ‘Waste A Moment’ this morning (September 9), as well as previewing new song ‘Over’ at a show in Poland last night. They appear on Later With Jools Holland on BBC2 next week (September 13) with Jack White, M83, Banks and Sting.
