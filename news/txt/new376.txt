Murdered Voice singer Christina Grimmie’s family thank fans as her GoFundMe appeal ends
The family of murdered The Voice singer Christina Grimmie have thanked fans as the one-month anniversary of her death nears. Grimmie was shot dead by fan Kevin Loibl before he killed himself, following a meet-and-greet at the 22-year-old singer’s show in Orlando on June 10. Grimmie’s manager launched a GoFundMe page the day after her death, which has so far raised over £150,000 in donations from 8,000 people, with funds going to support Grimmie’s family during their mourning. Parents Bud and Tina and brother Marcus said in a statement that Christina will “live on in our hearts forever”. The statement said: “The outpouring of love and generosity that has been displayed to our family throughout these last few weeks has far exceeded anything we could have ever imagined. “As we have always known, Christina’s life was so very special, not only to us, but to everyone she touched with her joyful heart, beautiful voice and love for life and the Lord. Words cannot express what the many memorials, donations and tributes shared by Christina’s fans and those in the media and entertainment industry mean to us. She will live on in our hearts forever. We will take our time in determining the best ways to honour Christina moving forward. Thank you.” Grimmie was managed by Selena Gomez’s stepfather Brian Teefy after he discovered here in 2011. Justin Bieber, Meghan Trainor and Fifth Harmony are among those who have paid tribute to Grimmie at their concerts. Maroon 5 singer Adam Levene was Grimmie’s mentor on The Voice, and he offered to pay her funeral expsense.
