Watch as Guns N’ Roses reunite with original drummer Steven Adler
Guns N’ Roses have been reunited with original drummer Steven Adler for the first time since 1990 at a gig in Cincinnati. Although Axl Rose, Slash and bassist Duff McKagan from the classic Guns N’ Roses line-up have been reunited for their comeback US tour, the band’s drummer has been Frank Ferrer from the pre-reunion line-up. Adler played on two songs at the show in Cincinnati’s Paul Brown Stadium, ‘Out Ta Get Me’ and ‘My Michelle’, joining Ferrer as a second drummer. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7sInic8ZFA With the rest of Guns N’ Roses’ most famous line-up reforming, it had been speculated that Adler would rejoin the band, having left in 1990 because of drug addiction. He was replaced by Matt Sorum of The Cult. It was reported that Adler was unable to rejoin for the ‘Not In This Lifetime’ reunion tour because of back surgery. With the tour so far having been harmonious since they first played together at Coachella festival in May, it seems further appearances for Adler may be possible. The tour line-up also includes keyboardist Dizzy Reed and guitarist Richard Fortus. It resumes in Nashville on Saturday (July 9), ending in August in San Diego. Rose said in June that he hopes the band will play in the UK “soon” and that the band may record a new album for their first with Slash and McKagan since 1993 covers album ‘The Spaghetti Incident?’
