Run The Jewels drop new song ‘Talk To Me’ – listen
Run The Jewels have released the first song from their upcoming third album. The hip-hop duo – El-P and Killer Mike – shared new track ‘Talk To Me’ today (October 24) on the two-year anniversary of their second album ‘Run The Jewels 2’ dropping. Listen below. Run The Jewels have contributed another new song, ‘Panther Like A Panther (I’m The Shit)’, to the trailer for Gears Of War 4. It is not known whether this song will also appear on ‘Run The Jewels 3’. El-P said last month that the duo’s new album has “officially been recorded”, but no release date has been specified yet. Meanwhile, El-P recently launched his own Pokémon remix competition. The rapper started the contest after mocking users of new game Pokémon Go on Twitter. “Real shit someone is going to get accidentally maimed or killed off this pokemon shit… then again i dont actually care. but i will laugh the second one of you gets hit by a car. or softly chuckle to myself. sadly. soft but sad,” he wrote. After fans reacted negatively to his comments, he said ahead of joking that he was hacked: “haha so many hurt feelings over pokemon disparagement… ok heres the deal: if in 1 year someone doesnt get seriously hurt playing that shit ill personally attempt to become a pokemaster.”
