AC/DC bassist Cliff Williams to retire after world tour
AC/DC bassist Cliff Williams has said that he will retire from the band after their current tour, and said that his decision was the ‘right thing’ to do. In an interview with Gulfshore Life, the bassist explained how he had decided to leave the band after it became a ‘changed animal’ in the wake of several members leaving. ”It’s been what I’ve known for the past 40 years, but after this tour I’m backing off of touring and recording,” Cliff told Gulfshore Life. “Losing Malcolm, the thing with Phil and now with Brian, it’s a changed animal. I feel in my gut it’s the right thing.” In 2014, guitarist Malcolm Young left the band after being diagnosed with dementia, while drummer Phil Rudd departed last year after he was sentenced to eight months of house arrest after being found guilty of threatening to kill a former employee. Frontman Brian Johnson was also forced to leave the band for their current tour after he was diagnosed with severe hearing damage, before being replaced by Guns n Roses frontman Axl Rose. But he also reflected on the band’s huge success, and how ‘Back in Black’ became the biggest selling album of all time. He said: “When you start out, you kind of hope for success. That’s what you are working for. But you never really know. It’s been surreal, really.”
