Kanye West wants to design school uniforms to ‘end classism and bullying worldwide’
Kanye West has announced his desire to design school uniforms. The rapper was speaking to TMZ when he was asked if he left anything out of his MTV VMAs speech at the weekend, which saw him address his controversial ‘Famous’ video and say that he’s “standing in front of the future”. Speaking to a TMZ paparazzo, West said that he wished to design school uniforms in his home city of Chicago, which he sees as “just as a starting point for eventually ending classism and bullying worldwide”. It wouldn’t be the hip-hop star’s first venture into apparel, having previously designed clothing and shoes for Nike, Adidas and his own tour merch.
