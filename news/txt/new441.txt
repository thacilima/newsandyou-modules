Watch Justin Bieber cover 2Pac and Tracy Chapman for Live Lounge
Justin Bieber performed three songs for BBC Radio 1’s Live Lounge earlier on Thursday (September 1). Following his recent V Festival headline sets, the singer performed acoustic renditions of 2Pac‘s ‘Thugz Mansion’, Tracy Chapman’s ‘Fast Car’ and his Major Lazer collaboration ‘Cold Water’. Watch below. Bieber’s appearance at V Festival last month was somewhat controversial, with some fans accusing him of miming. A press representative for the singer later dismissed this suggestion, saying there had been “no miming” during his V appearances. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjQZn4WNFE4 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-SUQatTsAo http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cqBP61cjYY Bieber is currently the holder of eight world records, according to the latest edition of Guinness’s famous book.
