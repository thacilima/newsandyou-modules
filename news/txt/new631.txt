Paul McCartney responds to Phil Collins over ‘feud’
Phil Collins‘ feud with Sir Paul McCartney has taken another twist, with the former Beatle attempting to make peace with the ex-Genesis man – but with Collins taking another dig at his ‘bad attitude’ Last week, Collins announced his live return with the ‘Not Dead Yet’ tour of Europe and the UK – before revealing a long-lasting grudge with Sir Paul. Speaking about a meeting with McCartney in which he asked him to sign some vinyl before he alleges Sir Paul spoke down to him, Collins said: “I thought, ‘You fuck, you fuck.’ Never forgot it. “He has this thing when he’s talking to you, where he makes you feel [like], ‘I know this must be hard for you because I’m a Beatle. I’m Paul McCartney and it must be very hard for you to actually be holding a conversation with me.’” Now, in an interview with Billboard, Collins says that McCartney has since contacted him about his comments… “He’s been in touch about it because he was upset,” said Collins. “I certainly didn’t get any flowers from him; I got more of a ‘Let’s just get on with our lives.’ And I’m sorry he’s upset that I kinda said something nasty about him — well, it wasn’t really nasty. If people don’t tell people that sometimes their attitude could be a bit better then you’re not gonna get any better, y’know?” Collins also revealed that he wouldn’t be playing drums at the upcoming shows due to extensive injuries, and that he’s not entirely against the idea of a Genesis reunion. Phil Collins’ upcoming tour dates are below. Phil Collins will play the following shows: London, Royal Albert Hall (June 4, 5, 7, 8, 9) Cologne, Lanxess Arena (11, 12) Paris, Accors Hotel Arena (18, 19)
