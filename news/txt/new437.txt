Justin Bieber warns Ed Sheeran not to ‘mess up’ career by doing ‘something stupid’
Justin Bieber has discussed his friendship with fellow singer Ed Sheeran while warning his counterpart not to “mess up” his career. The pair worked together on ‘Love Yourself’, a track from Bieber’s latest album ‘Purpose’ that Sheeran co-wrote. Speaking to Nick Grimshaw during his BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge this week, Bieber said: “Me and Ed aren’t super close but he’s someone who I consider a friend and I really appreciate his music. I appreciate who he is as a person. He’s an inspiration to a lot of young people – he makes awesome music that people are inspired by and that people laugh to, cry to and I think it’s important in music to have those people who bring the emotion out of you.” “There’s something about him that just makes you like him. He’s very likeable and very, very talented,” Bieber added. On what it was like working together, Bieber went on to say: “We found a sweet spot. I think that he knows what sounds good range-wise in my vocals and he’s got his ear to the streets. He’s very relevant but knows his stuff at the same time so he brings in stuff that he grew up listening to into what he’s making now which is really neat.” The singer – whose own troubles are well-documented – then said that he hopes Sheeran doesn’t do anything to jeopardise his career: “Let’s hope he doesn’t… we gotta make sure he doesn’t do something stupid to mess it all up.” For his Live Lounge session, Bieber performed acoustic renditions of 2Pac‘s ‘Thugz Mansion’, Tracy Chapman’s ‘Fast Car’ and his Major Lazer collaboration ‘Cold Water’.
