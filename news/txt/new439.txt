Watch Thom Yorke in video for Mark Pritchard collaboration ‘Beautiful People’
Mark Pritchard and Thom Yorke have shared a video for their collaborative track ‘Beautiful People’. Yorke leant his vocals to the electronic track, which features on Pritchard’s latest LP ‘Under the Sun’. Although the two artists hadn’t formally collaborated until this song, Pritchard previously remixed Radiohead’s ‘Bloom’, taken from the band’s last full-length, 2011’s ‘King of Limbs’. ‘Under the Sun’ was released in May via Warp Records. You can watch the ‘Beautiful People’ video below, which sees Yorke as some sort of shape-shifting space nomad. “The original instrumental to ‘Beautiful People’ is a personal song about loss, hopelessness and chaos, but ultimately the message is love and hope,” Pritchard previously said of the song. “Thom’s contribution to this collaboration captured perfectly what the piece is about. I will be forever grateful to have worked with such a immense talent.”
