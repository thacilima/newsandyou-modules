Listen to Celine Dion’s emotional new song in honour of late husband
Celine Dion has shared a new song called ‘Recovering’ in honour of her late husband. Rene Angelil, the singer’s husband and longtime manager, died in January after losing a long battle with throat cancer. Tragically, his death was followed by that of Celine Dion’s brother Daniel, who died from cancer only two days later. Dion will perform ‘Recovering’, written especially for her by Pink, on tonight’s Stand Up To Cancer telethon in the US. Discussing the song with EW, Pink said of Dion: “She is like a magic light bulb, walking around emanating light into the world. When I wrote this song, there was such a simple need to it. I know everyone wants to hear Celine wail, I wanted to hear Celine’s soul. She is just simply amazing.” When she announced that Pink had written a song for her back in July, Dion said: “She’s a genuine person and [it was] so generous of her to take the time to write a song for me during the most difficult time of mine.” “People have a tendency to send me really sad songs, and we do want to sing the touching songs, but life is beautiful, and I really want to believe that René has a life after his life, that he doesn’t suffer anymore,” Dion added.
