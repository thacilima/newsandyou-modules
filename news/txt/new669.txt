The Who’s Pete Townshend: “I don’t really like performing”
The Who’s Pete Townshend has admitted he gets no real buzz from playing live. The band recently performed at the massive Desert Trip festival in California, but even this failed to move the legendary guitarist. “I’m such a boring fucker. “It means nothing to me, ” he told The Times. “I would be a liar if I said, ‘It was really fun, man. It was great!’ It wasn’t great. It was a gig. I did it and I got paid. The fact is, I don’t really like performing. But I’m good at it. I’m lucky to be good at something. I could have worked in an abattoir.” Discussing how he feels when he comes off stage, Townshend added: “It’s a bit disingenuous to say I would rather have been a starving artist, but no, I don’t get high on stage. I might come off stage and look in the mirror and go, ‘Hee hee,’ but it’s mischievous. It’s, ‘What a load of crap. We pulled off another scam.'” During their set on Desert Trip on October 9, Pete Townshend introduced the band’s first US hit ‘I Can See for Miles’ by saying that it was “such a long fucking time ago.” He added playfully: “We were 1967’s version of Adele or Lady Gaga or Rihanna or Bieber.” The Who played the following songs during a two-hour set: I Can’t Explain The Seeker Who Are You The Kids Are Alright I Can See for Miles My Generation Behind Blue Eyes Bargain Join Together You Better You Bet 5:15 I’m One The Rock Love, Reign O’er Me Eminence Front Amazing Journey Sparks The Acid Queen Pinball Wizard See Me, Feel Me Baba O’Riley Won’t Get Fooled Again Meanwhile, frontman Roger Daltrey has explained why he opposes the planned remake of their classic film ‘Quadrophenia’.
