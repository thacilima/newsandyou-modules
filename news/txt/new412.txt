Chris Brown’s lawyer says no guns or drugs were found during police search of star’s home
Chris Brown‘s lawyer has said that no guns or drugs were found when police searched the star’s home following his arrest earlier this week. The singer was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon on Tuesday (August 30), but lawyer Mark Geragos has claimed there are contradictions in the story of Brown’s accuser. Brown was arrested after what was reported to be a long standoff between him and police outside his mansion, but Geragos said in a press conference to the media that that had been blown out of proportion, as Rolling Stone reports. “People have portrayed what happened with my client Chris Brown as a standoff with LAPD. First of all, I’d like to debunk that: This was not a ‘standoff,'” Geragos said on Friday (September 2). He added he had recommended Brown did not allow police to enter his home until they had obtained a search warrant, which they did on Tuesday afternoon. “Given his history, I think that was the prudent thing to do,” he said. Baylee Curran called the police on Tuesday morning alleging the singer had pointed a gun at her face after an encounter she said involved a diamond cross necklace. “There was also, by this so-called accuser, a statement that was given to the police that apparently there was some jewelry there and she described with great detail what this piece of jewelry was,” Geragos said. “We examined – and the officers had me stand there and we filmed it as well – the jewelry and nothing was found to corroborate her statement.” Geragos previously questioned Curran’s story, telling the Los Angeles Times: “It has become apparent that the allegations are not just false but fabricated.” Brown has not yet been formally charged with anything, but is scheduled to be arraigned on September 20.
