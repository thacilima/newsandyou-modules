Listen to The Naked And Famous’ comeback single ‘Higher’
The Naked And Famous have announced comeback album details and posted a new single online. The New Zealand band’s new record ‘Simple Forms’ is out on October 14, via their label Somewhat Damaged in partnership with Kobalt Label Services.  The record is their first since 2013’s ‘In Rolling Waves’. Their debut album – ‘Passive Me, Aggressive You’ was released in 2010. The five-piece have also released a lyric video for their comeback single ‘Higher’, which is out today and you can listen to below. ‘Simple Forms’ was produced in the Echo Park home studio of guitarist/vocalist/producer Thom Powers at a point where the band said they “had come close to tearing themselves apart under the strain of the breakdown of the eight year romance between Powers and co-vocalist Alisa Xayalith”. “My production idea in The Naked and Famous has always been to set the insularity of our songwriting in a space where intimacy and explosive excitement can bring tension and release,” says Powers. “To me, that is what contemporary pop should be. Our ambition is that this music be noticed and we’re proud of what we’ve achieved in the studio.” “There’s pain and passion behind this art,” adds Xayalith. “Pop techniques are all about maximum impact. And it’s not like this is an album of bangers but it’s the most immediate thing we’ve ever done.” The band are set to play a series of US dates later this year including the Santa Monica Pier on August 5 and the Austin City Limits Music Festival over the weekends of September 30 – October 2 and October 7-9.
