Chris Brown’s accuser told friend she would ‘set him up’ in alleged text message
The woman who accused Chris Brown of assaulting her with a deadly weapon has had her version of events called into question – after allegedly sending a text in which she claimed to be planning a false allegation against the star. TMZ claims to have seen a text sent from Baylee Curran, who accused the star of assault, in which she outlines her plans to fake an allegation against Brown. The text, which was allegedly sent at 2.57am on Tuesday to a friend, is reported to say: ‘Don’t you know this freak Chris brown is kicking me out of his house because I called his friend jewellery fake. ‘Can you come get me my Uber is messing up if not I’m going to set him up and call the cops and say that he tried to shoot me and that will teach him a lesson I’m going to set his ass up. Lol come get me’. But Curran has since denied the claims – while her friend says that the pair haven’t spoken since 2015. Chris Brown was arrested in the early hours of Tuesday morning at his LA home after a tense stand off with police, who arrived at the property after receiving an allegation of assault from Curran. His lawyer has since refuted the allegations, and says that no weapons were found at the singer’s home. Thanks to everyone for their support and well wishes. Chris is out and well.
