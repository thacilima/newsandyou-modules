Rita Ora to sing for the Pope at event honouring Mother Teresa in the Vatican
Rita Ora has revealed that she is singing in front of Pope Francis this weekend. The pop singer has been asked to perform at a ceremony in the Vatican this Sunday (September 4) honouring Mother Teresa‘s canonisation, she told Jimmy Fallon during an appearance on his chat show. “I’m going to the Vatican, I leave tomorrow! I’m more of a spiritual person, so the Vatican I figured out is actually a big deal,” Ora told Fallon jokingly. As Spin points out, both Ora and the late Mother Teresa have Albanian heritage, which could at least partly explain why she was asked to perform at the canonisation ceremony, which will see Mother Teresa officially decreed a Saint. Meanwhile, it has recently been reported that Ora wants to work with Tame Impala on her forthcoming second album. The singer, who has recently signed a new deal with Atlantic Records after settling her contract dispute with Jay Z’s Roc Nation, is apparently keen on the band’s “psychedelic sound”. Announcing her new global record deal with Atlantic in June, Ora said: “Music is my first love and I am looking forward to getting my new songs released. I’m thankful to my new Atlantic Records family for all their support and encouragement. The next chapter is going to be incredible.” Her debut album ‘Ora’ came out in 2012 and peaked at Number One in the UK. Since then she has released several singles, including the chart-topping ‘I Will Never Let You Down’, but her follow-up album was stalled by her dispute with Roc Nation.
