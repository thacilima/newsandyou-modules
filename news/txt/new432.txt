Olly Murs announces arena tour after attacking state of the charts
Olly Murs has announced an extensive arena tour for March next year, following the release of his new abum ‘24HRS’. The album, out November 11, is the singer’s fifth and follows 2014’s ‘Never Been Better’. It features last Christmas’ single ‘Kiss Me’ and his new song ‘You Don’t Know Love’, which he will perform on BBC1’s Strictly Come Dancing tomorrow. ‘You Don’t Know Love’ has so far peaked at No 19, and Murs has attacked the state of the chart, saying that the introduction of streaming makes it harder for British artists to succeed. Murs told Digital Spy: “’You Don’t Know Love’ has gone well, but it’s still not where I want it to be. I think it’s hard now for any artist – especially British artists to get to No 1. Streaming is so popular that, if you’re an in-demand act, people obviously want to listen to your music. The chart now, for breaking artists, is harder. It’s not a fair chart at the moment.” Tickets for the arena tour go on general sale next Friday (September 9) with a pre-sale via Songkick from Tuesday. It follows Murs’ appearance at Barclaycard Presents British Summer Time in June, when he played with Take That. Olly Murs will play: Glasgow SSE Hydro (March 3) Newcastle Metro Radio Arena (6) Leeds First Direct Arena (9) Sheffield Arena (10) Nottingham Motorpoint Arena (13) Liverpool Echo Arena (16) Manchester Arena (17) Cardiff Motorpoint Arena (20) Birmingham Genting Arena (24) Bournemouth BIC (28) London O2 Arena (30-31) Dublin 3 Arena (April 3) Belfast SSE Arena (5)
