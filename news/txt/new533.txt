Kings Of Leon admit ‘We became business partners’ and got into a comfort zone
Kings Of Leon have admitted to NME that they became “business partners” rather than a proper band during the height of their success. The band release new album ‘WALLS’ on October 14, their first since ‘Mechanical Bull’ in 2013. And the Followill clan have admitted ‘WALLS’ is their first album in some time when they’re fully functioning as a band. Speaking in the new issue of NME – which is available nationwide tomorrow (September 9) – singer Caleb Followill said: “After a while, it’s not ‘I’m going to do an interview with my brother’, it’s ‘I’m going to do an interview with the drummer’. When you get together, it’s never ‘We are the band’. We lost that.” Followill added that the band’s familial relationship eventually broke down, saying: “There were a lot of moments when we weren’t talking. It was ‘Man, we’ve become business partners.We haven’t maintained our friendship and our brotherhood, everything that we are.” Bassist Jared Followill said that having money to travel separately gave each other privacy, but also meant they stopped hanging out. He said: “We’d only see each other for the hour-and-a-half before a show. We went too far in the other direction. If you’re going to be friends and family, you can’t really be a band, or we can’t be this band.” Caleb explained the band tried to mend their relationships on ‘Mechanical Bull’, but that they also stayed in their comfort zone musically while becoming friends again. He said: “We were definitely going for it and trying really hard, but we got into a comfort zone. We’ve tried to peel that away on this album, by not using the same producer and doing it in our studio. We were really challenging ourselves, doing things where we were scratching our heads going ‘Holy shit, is this right? Is this wrong?’” The full interview will be available online tomorrow.
