Donna Summer Broadway musical in the works
A musical based on the life and music of Donna Summer is currently in the works. The Queen of Disco released a string of classic dancefloor numbers in the 70s, including ‘Hot Stuff’, ‘Bad Girls’, ‘Last Dance’ and ‘I Feel Love’. The project is being brought to Broadway by some of the talent behind hit shows like Jersey Boys and Hamilton, according to a report in the New York Post. Des McAnuff, the award-winning director of Jersey Boys, staged a workshop in New York last week of early parts of the show. In the workshop, the part of Donna Summer was played by Ariana DeBose, who has previously appeared in both Hamilton and Broadway musical Motown. Two more actors will portray Summer at different stages of her life: through childhood, superstardom during disco’s heyday and in her later years. Summer, who was born in Boston in 1948, died in Naples, Florida in 2012 of lung cancer. She was 63.
