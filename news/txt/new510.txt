Speaking in the new issue – which is available nationwide today (September 9) – singer Caleb Followill said: “After a while, it’s not ‘I’m going to do an interview with my brother’, it’s ‘I’m going to do an interview with the drummer’. When you get together, it’s never ‘We are the band’. We lost that.” READ: World Exclusive Comeback Interview: How Kings Of Leon Rebuilt Their Family – And Their Sound. Followill added that the band’s familial relationship eventually broke down, saying: “There were a lot of moments when we weren’t talking. It was ‘Man, we’ve become business partners. We haven’t maintained our friendship and our brotherhood, everything that we are.” Bassist Jared Followill said that having money to travel separately gave each other privacy, but also meant they stopped hanging out. He said: “We’d only see each other for the hour-and-a-half before a show. We went too far in the other direction. If you’re going to be friends and family, you can’t really be a band, or we can’t be this band.” You can see the full tracklisting for ‘Walls’ below. ‘Waste A Moment’ ‘Reverend’ ‘Around The World’ ‘Find Me’ ‘Over’ ‘Muchacho’ ‘Conversation Piece’ ‘Eyes On You’ ‘Wild’ ‘WALLS’ You can also hear a snippet of new music from ‘Walls’ through the album teaser trailer below.
