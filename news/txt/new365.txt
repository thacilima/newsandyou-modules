Mumford & Sons impersonate Blink-182 in ‘Brohemian Rhapsody’ video
Mumford and Sons have impersonated Blink-182 in a short clip. In the video, Marcus Mumford and his bandmates dress up like the Californian punk trio in tube socks, shorts and backwards baseball caps. The band then pretend to play along to Blink-182’s song ‘Brohemian Rhapsody’, which is taken from their latest album, ‘California’. At the end of the clip, Mark Hoppus and his band walk into the dressing room, startling Mumford and Sons. “What the…” exclaims Hoppus, before the video ends. The video is to promote Blink-182’s US tour, which began on Tuesday (July 5) in Washington D.C. and runs until October 8, when the band will wrap things up in Irvine, California. Watch the video below. Blink-182 recently revealed their first video since Tom DeLonge’s departure from the band. The clip sees the three-piece, which now features Matt Skiba on guitar, playing in an underground club, with shots of the band performing interspersed with the main narrative of a bored high school student daydreaming about what he’d rather be doing than sitting in class.
