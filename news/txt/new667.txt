Kanye West says he’ll skip the Grammys if Frank Ocean isn’t nominated
Kanye West has warned fans that he’ll boycott the Grammys if Frank Ocean‘s recent album isn’t nominated. West is currently on his Saint Pablo tour and took time out of his performance in Oakland last night (October 22) to comment on the Grammys. “The album I listen to the most this year is Frank Ocean’s album,” he said. “I’ll tell you this right now: If his album’s not nominated in no categories, I’m not showing up to the Grammys.” West also speaks of working with Ocean on ‘Wolves’ saying how he talked to West about how the song made him feel before writing the outro ‘Frank’s Track’. West also mentioned Ocean’s reported falling out with Def Jam. “They get smacked in they face over political bullshit,” he said. He then encourages the head of the Grammys to “come and holla at Ye.” Meanwhile, Frank Ocean has given his first interview for three years, after speaking at a state dinner at The White House. Ocean hasn’t given any interviews to promote his recent album ‘Blonde’ or its companion visual album ‘Endless’, and last spoke publicly in depth around his 2012 album ‘Channel Orange’. But the singer gave an impromptu interview on The White House red carpet, when a reporter asked Ocean about his checked Vans trainers. He also discussed visiting The White House, attending the state dinner with his mother, Katonya Breaux.
