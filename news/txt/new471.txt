Taylor Swift is reportedly back in the studio
Taylor Swift is reportedly back in the studio. The singer, who released her last album ‘1989‘ in 2014, attended Tommy Hilfiger’s New York Fashion Week show last night (September 9), where her friend Gigi Hadid was modelling and debuting her clothing line collaboration with the designer. Speaking to Entertainment Tonight afterwards, Hadid said: “She’s obviously such a great friend, and you know, she is starting to go back to work in the studio again and really made time to be here for me and I am so grateful for that.” Earlier, it was reported Swift has donated $5,000 (£3,800) to the family of a fan who is mourning the loss of her sister in a tragic car accident. Katie Beth Carter, an 18-year-old freshman at Jacksonville State University from Georgia, was involved in a fatal car crash last weekend, Billboard reports. Friends of her family have since set up a crowd-funding campaign to “to show love and support to her parents Jason and Amy Carter, and siblings Jacob and Kimi Carter, by helping to cover medical expenses and the cost of her arrangements”. At the time of writing, it has amassed over $36,000 (£37,000) of its $40,000 (£30,000) target. Among the donations is a $5,000 gift from Swift, who writes on the campaign’s GoFundMe page: “Kimi, No words could express how sorry I am for your loss. I know that you will keep Katie’s memory alive. Please know how much I am thinking of you and saying a prayer for your family. All my love, Taylor.”
