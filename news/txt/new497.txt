The 1975’s Matt Healy’s stepfather holds exhibition of paintings of rock stars
The 1975 singer Matt Healy’s stepfather is holding an exhibition of his paintings of singers. Artist Lincoln Townley, who has been married to Healy’s actress mother Denise Welch since 2013, is currently hosting his MusicICONS exhibition at London’s Maddox Gallery. It features Townley’s painting of David Bowie, which sold for £250,000 this year, as well as a portrait of Prince which sold for £300,000. Other musicians Townley has painted for the MusicICONS series include Morrissey, Elvis Presley, Kylie Minogue, Roger Daltrey, David Gilmour, Jimi Hendrix, Kurt Cobain, Sting, Marc Almond, Peter Hook, Brian Johnson of AC/DC, ZZ Top’s Billy Gibbons, Ozzy Osbourne, Dave Stewart of Eurythmics and Bono and The Edge. Townley said: “I wanted to create a collection that captures the energy and essence of what these performers are about, musically and as people.” Almond has since bought Townley’s portrait of him and said: “Many people have created images of me, but Lincoln’s use of the colours that inhabit my world made it a portrait I had to own.” Townley, a former marketing director for London nightclub Stringfellow’s, has previously painted many actors including Michael Caine, who said of Townley: “There’s no doubt in my mind that Lincoln is the next Andy Warhol.”
