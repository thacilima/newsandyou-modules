Listen to Sleaford Mods’ new single as they announce five-track EP
Sleaford Mods have announced a new five-song EP. Out on October 14, ‘TCR’ features the title track, plus ‘I Can Tell’, ‘Britain Thirst’, ‘Dad’s Corner’ and ‘You’re A Nottshead’. ‘TCR’ stands for “Total Control Racing” and is named after a Scalextric-style toy racing car game popular in the 1980s. Talking about the song, vocalist Jason Williamson said: “The idea behind the ‘TCR’ video was to show and use the actual 1980s toy racing kit in its original environment, which would have most probably been the living room floor for most kids at that time.” Williamson added: “It’s a pretty crap device, and I thought it married perfectly to the idea of life’s (at times) rotating dross. The narration/vocal over the song is just that, an account of a bloke reacting to what he feels is a routine-laden existence by ‘escaping’ for the night to the pub, only to realise this is also a limited experience, and in turn all options kind of merge into a circular experience of never ending repetition that he tries to navigate.” Williamson is also due to make his acting debut in the film Lost Dog. He will play happily-married Robbo, reunited with his former childhood friend Icky, played by Jamie Beddard of Extraordinary Bodies. Giving an insight into disability rights, a crowdfunding page has been set up seeking donations from £5-£150 for a range of bonuses from the film-makers. The duo go on a full 11-date tour in October. Sleaford Mods will play: Glasgow O2 ABC (October 19) Newcastle Academy (24) Leeds Beckett Uni (26) Manchester Academy (27) Liverpool Mountford Hall (28) Brighton Corn Exchange (31) Nottingham Rock City (November 3-4) Coventry Empire (7) Bristol Academy (8) London Roundhouse (10)
