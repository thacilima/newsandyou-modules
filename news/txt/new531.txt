Guns N’ Roses guitarist Izzy Stradlin explains why he’s not part of their reunion
Former Guns N’ Roses guitarist Izzy Stradlin has explained why he’s not taking part in the band’s reunion tour. In a TV interview on Tuesday (September 6), Axl Rose had expressed his bafflement at why Stradlin wasn’t taking part in the ‘Not In This Lifetime’ tour. Rose said: “I don’t even know what to say. We make arrangements, and then he goes and does other things. With Izzy, you never know what to expect.” https://twitter.com/IzzyStradlin999/status/773679504044625920 But a tweet by Stradlin shot down Rose’s comments. Stradlin said: “Bullshit. They didn’t want to spit the loot equally. Simple as that. Moving right along…” The tour has reunited Rose with guitarist Slash and bassist Duff McKagan on stage together for the first time since 1993. Original drummer Steven Adler has also missed most of the tour, but that’s because he has required back surgery, with Adler joining on stage at shows when he’s been physically able. Stradlin has actually played with Guns N’ Roses several times since he first left in 1991. He first played five shows in 1993 as a stand-in when his replacement Gilby Clarke broke his wrist, before playing a European tour with Rose’s line-up in 2006 and for five shows in 2012. The guitarist has also released 11 solo albums, most recently ‘Wave Of Heat’ in 2010.
