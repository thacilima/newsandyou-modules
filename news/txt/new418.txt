The Shins perform two new songs during End of the Road festival set
The Shins played two new songs during their set at End of the Road festival last night (September 1). In performing on the Dorset festival’s main stage yesterday, the Portland five-piece registered their first show in the UK for four years. To mark the occasion, the band debuted two new songs during the set. As The Line of Best Fit reports, The Shins played ‘Dead Alive’ (described as having “a classic, spangly Shins sound”) and ‘Rubber Balls’. The band also played ‘Young Pilgrims’, with frontman James Mercer taking up solo acoustic duties for the 2003 cut. As he started the song, Mercer joked that he didn’t know the words, claiming not to have performed it for eight years.

Mercer told US radio station KBOO 90.7: “I’m really excited about this record. I think we’ve got something that Shins fans will really love, and I think there are some other things on there that are different enough.”
