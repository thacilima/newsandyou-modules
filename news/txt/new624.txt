Liam Gallagher hits out at ‘bread head’ Noel
Liam Gallagher has once again hit out at brother and former Oasis bandmate Noel Gallagher on social media, referring to him a “bread head”. The Gallagher brothers have had a tense relationship since the Britpop group’s 2009 split, with Liam recently criticising Noel publicly, calling him a potato, a toad, a “scary clown”, describing him as the “Ronnie Corbett of rock” and comparing his brother’s dress sense to that of Gary Barlow. Liam has also compared Noel to Hitler and Oasis to Jesus. Noel appeared on Channel 4’s Stand Up To Cancer fundraiser at the weekend, paying tribute to the late Caroline Aherne with a performance of ‘Half The World Away’. Liam appeared to refer to his brother’s performance on Twitter, writing: “Good to see the BREAD HEADS doing [their] bit for charity”. Urban Dictionary defines a “bread head” as “a person who’s only concern is money”.

Liam told The Sunday Times: “Obviously [our mum would] like us to be chatting, sit around the table at Christmas. But it’s a stupid standoff, and we should know better, as we have kids. It would be nice for me and [Noel] to get back together as brothers. But it’s good, the standoff. I’m enjoying it. I ain’t backing down. He ain’t backing down.” “At least people are still talking about it. They’re obsessed,” he added. “There’s no harm in it. He says shit about me. I say shit about him. I have held the olive branch out, and there has been nothing, so there you go. Potato it is, mate.” Liam recently opened up about his troubled relationship with Noel and revealed the one thing that’s stopping the long-rumoured Oasis reunion.
