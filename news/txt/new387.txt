Kanye West is hiring a team to work on new clothing line
Adidas have posted job openings for a team that will work on a new line of Kanye West clothing. West recently announced that he is expanding his partnership with the sportswear brand to make a “YEEZY branded entity creating footwear, apparel and accessories for all genders across street and sport.” Adidas have previously released trainers designed by West, which have often gone for prices in the thousands in secondary markets due to high demand. “I ain’t drop an album but the shoes went platinum,​” West rapped on ‘Facts’, released earlier this year. The company is now hiring 17 people to bring West’s vision to life. The jobs are all located in Portland, Oregon and include positions like Senior Designer Footwear, Senior Manager Public Relations, and more. Meanwhile, West’s latest music video, which features naked prosthetic doubles of famous celebrities, has, unsurprisingly, landed him in hot water. Ray J, an ex-boyfriend of his wife Kim Kardashian, is reportedly considering suing West for using his likeness in the 10-minute video.
