Watch Neil Young join Metallica for cover of Buffalo Springfield’s ‘Mr. Soul’
Neil Young joined Metallica last night (October 22) to perform a cover of Buffalo Springfield’s 1967 single ‘Mr. Soul’. The performance took place at the Bridge School Benefit Concert benefit at Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California. Young also performed a cover of Bob Dylan’s ‘Forever Young’ alongside Roger Waters and My Morning Jacket’s Jim James. You can see footage of the Buffalo Springfield cover below. Earlier this month, Paul McCartney was joined onstage by Neil Young during his headline set on the second night of Desert Trip festival in California. The mini-festival takes place at the Empire Polo Field in Indio, California, the same site where Coachella is held. Held over two weekends, it saw McCartney, Young, The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Roger Waters and The Who performing live. Both McCartney and Young headlined Saturday night’s leg (October 8) after Dylan and the Stones opened proceedings on Friday (October 7). Following Young’s co-headline set, McCartney invited the singer-songwriter back onto the stage to perform a rendition of The Beatles’ ‘A Day In The Life’, which morphed into a take on John Lennon’s ‘Give Peace a Chance’. The pair also performed Beatles track ‘Why Don’t We Do It in the Road’, the first time Macca has ever played the song live.
