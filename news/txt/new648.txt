Zayn Malik talks Beatles influence in new autobiography extract
A new extract from Zayn Malik‘s forthcoming autobiography has revealed how the singer considers The Beatles to be an important influence on his own music. The autobiography, titled Zayn, is set for release on November 1. The first published excerpt from the book detailed how the 23-year-old “was able to sing about a subject that I hadn’t really been able to go near while I was in One Direction: sex.” In the new extract, published today over on The Fader, Malik revealed how he’d been regularly listening to The Beatles while making his debut album, ‘Mind of Mine’. “I’d been listening to a lot of tracks by the Beatles when I was working on it,” Malik writes. “I had really got into some of their more psychedelic stuff, like ‘Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds’ from the 1967 album ‘Sergeant Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band’. The piano chords at the start of ‘Fool for You,’ and the guitars, were inspired by the Beatles’ sound… I like to draw on the influence of all sorts of music and artists.” The singer also revealed that he’d written 48 songs for his album, a figure that he himself couldn’t quite believe. “When I’d finally finished recording Mind of Mine, I realized I had put down forty-eight songs. I couldn’t believe we had so many. It was a nightmare choosing the final list, especially because all the songs meant a lot to me, and I procrastinated as much as I could before making my decision. In the end, it all came together; the songs chosen for the album spoke for themselves.” Read more: Zayn Malik: House of Zayn – The Full NME Cover Interview Last week, Azealia Banks published a letter of apology to Malik following their Twitter dispute earlier this year.
