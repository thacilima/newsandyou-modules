Green Day’s Billie Joe Armstrong stars as aging punk in new film ‘Ordinary World’
Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong stars in a new film called Ordinary World, set to be released in the US in October. According to Deadline, Armstrong plays the part of Perry, “an aging former punk rocker who’s now a married father of two”. The synopsis continues: “[Perry] leads a sedate life in Queens until his brother (Chris Messina) gives him money to throw a huge 40th birthday rockstar bash in a fancy Manhattan hotel — a chance to get it out of his system. But Perry’s punk past clashes with his middle-age reality.” The film, which first premiered at Tribeca in April, also stars Judy Greer, Selma Blair, Dallas Roberts, Fred Armisen, Brian Baumgartner and Kevin Corrigan. Lee Kirk directs. READ MORE: New Green Day Album – Everything We Know About The Long-Awaited Record Meanwhile, Green Day recently said they’re worried about video games becoming increasingly violent. The trio, who release new album ‘Revolution Radio’ on October 7, have said they’re worried about the world becoming so violent that it’s going to scar their children. Bassist Mike Dirnt told Kerrang!: “My kids are going to grow up seeing things that I never saw, like Mixed Martial Arts. When that first came out, people were ‘Oh fuck, that’s fucking violent.’ And now they play it on TV in restaurants. I’m supposed to eat and watch this shit wherever I go? Nothing makes me hungrier than watching two guys in weenie bikinis kicking the shit out of each other.” Dirnt added: “Video games are different now too. You’re actually in there shooting and killing people. And that’s got to take a toll, but I don’t have the solutions.”
