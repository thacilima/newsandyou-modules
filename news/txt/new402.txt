The rapper started the contest after mocking users of new game Pokémon Go on Twitter. “Real shit someone is going to get accidentally maimed or killed off this pokemon shit… then again i dont actually care. but i will laugh the second one of you gets hit by a car. or softly chuckle to myself. sadly. soft but sad,” he wrote. After fans reacted negatively to his comments, he said ahead of joking that he was hacked: “haha so many hurt feelings over pokemon disparagement… ok heres the deal: if in 1 year someone doesnt get seriously hurt playing that shit ill personally attempt to become a pokemaster.”
