Watch Frank Black and Michael Shannon star in ‘Sexiest elbows in rock’ video
Pixies frontman Frank Black, Jeff Tweedy, Sharon Van Etten, actor Michael Shannon and comedian Todd Barry have appeared in a new video. The clip – ‘The Sexiest Elbows in Rock’ – is a trailer for Split Single‘s second LP ‘Metal Frames’ and their forthcoming mockumentary. You can watch the trailer below. They plan to release two episodes of the series in November. The project involves Jason Narducy’s (of Bob Mould Band, Superchunk) project with a rotating cast of musicians. In 2014, Narducy released Split Single’s debut record, ‘Fragmented World’, with Spoon’s Britt Daniel and Jon Wurster (of Scharpling and Wurster, Superchunk). They released a similar video in 2014 featuring guest stars including Dave Grohl. The new record features Narducy, Wurster, and Wilco bassist John Stirratt and it is released on November 18. The tracklisting includes tracks such as ‘Glori’, ‘Untry Love’, ‘Blank Ribbons’ and ‘Leave My Mind’. Pixies also recently confirmed that their guitarist Joey Santiago has entered rehab. He checked in to a rehabilitation centre “for at least 30 days to treat his alcohol and drug issues”, according to a statement. “This is the best thing that Joey could have done, and we’re very proud that he’s taken this step,” said drummer David Lovering in the statement. “We ask all of our fans to support Joey while he’s on this road to recovery.” The statement continues that “while the Pixies fully intend to tour the UK and Europe this November and December, Santiago’s time in rehab will affect some of the band’s planned promotional activities to support their new album”. Pixies are set to tour the UK next month. They will play the following live dates: Brixton O2 Academy (November 28-29, December 6) Leeds O2 Academy (30) Glasgow Barrowland (December 2) Newcastle O2 Academy (3) Manchester O2 Apollo (4) Cardiff Motorpoint Arena (7) Birmingham O2 Academy (8)
