Radiohead reveal fan-made videos for ‘Daydreaming’
Radiohead have shared shortlisted entries from their ‘Daydreaming’ video competition. Back in July, the band asked fans to submit a one-minute clip for their next music video. As part of the series of vignettes that have accompanied the release of their ninth studio album, ‘A Moon Shaped Pool’, the five-piece called on fans to submit their own visual contributions to the project. The band also released a one-minute-long string version of the album’s second single, ‘Daydreaming’, which will serve as the soundtrack for the winner of the fan-made video competition. Once all of the entries are in, Radiohead will pick the winner and post it to their official site. You can watch some of the shortlisted clips below.
