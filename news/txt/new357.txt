ROD STEWART CANCELS ANOTHER LONDON SHOW
Rod Stewart fans have been advised to hold on to their tickets for tonight’s postponed LONDON show (May 12). The singer’s tour has been on ice all week after he was struck down with a severe viral throat infection. The tour has already visited Manchester and Glasgow, and this is the third consecutive show to be pulled at London Earl’s Court. Ticket holders are advised that they will be valid for rescheduled dates, although refunds can be obtained from the point of purchase. Rod Stewart hopes to continue the tour on Saturday night (May 14) at Birmingham NEC.
