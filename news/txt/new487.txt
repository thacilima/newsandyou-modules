The South African rap-rave group formed in Cape Town in 2008 and was founded by rappers Ninja and Yolandi Visser as well as DJ Hi-Tek. The band have also released a new track in lieu of the news of their break-up. You can listen to ‘FAT FADED FUCK FACE’ below. Speaking to Exclaim!, Ninja confirmed that the group are set to officially disband in September, 2017. “Die Antwoord dies on that day. It’s all over. I feel beautiful about it. I’m not scared of the end. I’m a Ninja. I’m not scared of death,” he said. Speaking of the band’s movie ‘South African Ninja’, Ninja explained that they’ve “been working on it forever – literally like ten years,” continuing that the film “has some parrallel” to their lives. “[The movie] has been our well that we’ve been drinking from and drawing from since the beginning of Die Antwoord,” he continued. “We actually started writing it before Die Antwoord. So, it’s been in the background for all of our ideas, which have all come from this film.” “It’s a South African gangster film that has African ninjas in it. Everything in the film is fictitious, like a regular movie, but it’s hard and raw, and everything has some parallel to our lives, so it’s got a surreal connection to everything,” he said. Speaking to Exclaim! in 2010, MCs Ninja and Yo-Landi Vi$$er said that they planned to release five albums, five movies and then “disappear.”
