Ska music pioneer Prince Buster has died, aged 78
Jamaican music legend Prince Buster has died at the age of 78. He passed away this morning (September 8) at a hospital in South Florida, the Jamaica Observer reports, having been ill for some time following a series of strokes. His death was confirmed by his son, Kareem Ali. The singer, songwriter and producer – born Cecil Bustamente Campbell – was revered as a pioneer of Jamaican ska and rocksteady music all through the ’60s. After originally being released in 1964, his single ‘Al Capone’ became a hit in the UK three years later. Prince Buster later became a major influence on the UK’s late-’70s ska revival. Madness‘s 1979 single ‘The Prince’ was written in tribute to him and during the same year, the Camden band took a cover of Prince Buster’s song ‘One Step Beyond’ into the UK Top Ten. The Specials also covered and sampled several of Prince Buster’s songs. In 1998, Prince Buster notched up a second UK hit when his ’60s single ‘Whine And Grine’ was used in a Levi’s advert. Three years later, he was awarded the Order of Distinction by the Jamaican Government for his contribution to music. He performed in the UK as recently as 2007.
