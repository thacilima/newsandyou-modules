Bob Dylan to unveil huge iron sculpture
Bob Dylan will be unveiling a huge 26-by-15-foot iron sculpture at the entrance of the $1.3 billion MGM National Harbor resort casino in Prince’s County, Maryland. Set to open later this year, the piece is titled ‘Portal’ and will be Dylan’s first permanent piece for a public space. According to Rolling Stone, ‘Portal’ will be made of hand-selected found objects, including farm equipment, kitchen utensils and tools. https://twitter.com/akanoodles/status/773549101862490112 Dylan has been creating sculptures and art pieces out of iron and other metals for friends and family for the past 30 years, but only in 2013, at the Halcyon Gallery in London, did he exhibit his metalwork publicly. ‘Moodswings’ was unveiled in 2013 and featured seven iron gates welded out of vintage iron who stated in a press release for the event, has had a “lifelong fascination with welding and metalwork”. Dylan commented: “I’ve been around iron all my life ever since I was a kid. I was born and raised in iron ore country – where you could breathe it and smell it every day. And I’ve always worked with it in one form or another.” He continued, “Gates appeal to me because of the negative space they allow. They can be closed but at the same time they allow the seasons and breezes to enter and flow. They can shut you out or shut you in. And in some ways there is no difference.”
