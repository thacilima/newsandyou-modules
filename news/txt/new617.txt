The Strokes’ Nikolai Fraiture shares first song from new band Summer Moon
The Strokes bassist Nikolai Fraiture has shared the first song from his new band Summer Moon. Summer Moon is fronted by Fraiture, with the line-up also featuring Stephen Perkins of Jane’s Addiction, Camila Grey of Uh Huh Her and Noah Harmon of The Airborne Toxic Event. ‘With You Tonight’ is Summer Moon’s first video and was shot with real-life NYC magicians. The interactive, VR video was shot by the Weird Days Collective, who have worked on the Real Estate video for ‘It’s Real’ as well as Santigold’s ‘Girls’ video. You can watch ‘With You Tonight’ below. Speaking in a statement about the video, Fraiture said; “The video is about two people coming home from a dance ball and stumbling into a strange, occult world filled with bizarre characters all displaying their mystical powers.” He continued, “The VR lends an eeriness where you lose your sense of reality and become completely immersed in the experience. You can explore around so you never see the same video twice. It feels like Sleep No More in one room.” The debut album from Summer Moon is set for release in early 2017. Meanwhile, guitarist Nick Valensi has confirmed that The Strokes are working on a new album. The NYC band returned with a three-track EP called ‘Future Present Past’ in June, but their last full-length album was 2013’s ‘Comedown Machine’, which was released amid a “media blackout” from the band whereby they declined all interview requests and TV appearances. “We are slowly but surely working on an album,” Valensi  told DIY. “I don’t know when it’s going to be released, we’re kind of just in writing sessions. We’re writing.” Valensi has also formed a new band, CRX, who will release their debut album ‘New Skin’ produced by Josh Homme on October 28.
