Watch The Libertines play first full British gig for nine months
The Libertines played their first official British show for nine months last night (September 7) with a charity show at Brixton O2 Academy. The concert was arranged by drummer Gary Powell in aid of Unity Rocks, the charity Powell set up to support Hope Not Hate. Although The Libertines played a secret gig at London pub The Boogaloo in July, the Brixton show was their first full concert since they headlined London’s O2 Arena at the end of their arena tour in January.
