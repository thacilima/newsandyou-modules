Matt Healy was ‘pissed and talking shit’ when he said The 1975 were set to record new album
The 1975 frontman Matt Healy has backtracked on comments he made at Reading Festival last weekend when he said his band were set to record their next album. The group released their second record ‘I Like It When You Sleep, For You Are So Beautiful Yet So Unaware Of It’ in February, reaching Number One in both the UK and US album charts. Ahead of set closer ‘Sex’ at Reading, Healy told the crowd: “I don’t know what the future holds, but I can promise you two things. One: we’re gonna go away and make another record. Two: we’re gonna come back and we’re gonna fucking headline Reading, I fucking promise you.” Now, speaking to NME, Healy has clarified that he was “pissed and talking shit”. He said: “I was pissed out my head. Absolutely pissed and talking shit.” While their next album may not come as swiftly as fans expected following his previous comments, Healy did confirm that they have been taking steps towards album number three. “We are gonna make another record,” he said. “We never stopped. What I’ve realised, even for the second album we never stopped. We’re always making music, that’s what we do. We will make another record and it will probably happen in a similar way to how we made the last one. We’ll just kind of curate it over the next couple of years, or the next year or so and then put something out.” Read NME‘s review of The 1975’s Reading Festival set.
