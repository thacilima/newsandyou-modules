Watch Cat Power, Wayne Coyne, Debbie Harry pay tribute to David Bowie in new documentary
Cat Power, Wayne Coyne, Laurie Anderson and many other artists have contributed to a new documentary paying tribute to David Bowie. The short film was shot during a Bowie tribute concert at Carnegie Hall and Radio City Music Hall in New York earlier this year. Recorded backstage during rehearsals, the performers reflected on the late musician’s legacy and revealed their favourite songs. Among those who are also featured in the film are: Michael Stipe, Debbie Harry, the Mountain Goats’ John Darnielle, Esperanza Spalding, Cyndi Lauper, Bilal, Perry Farrell, Rickie Lee Jones, Robyn Hitchcock, and Heart’s Ann Wilson. Notable moments include Cat Power describing Bowie as a “mother figure in a weird way”, Debbie Harry reminiscing about her first US tour with Bowie and Wayne Coyne likening the star to a “mythological entity”. Meanwhile, ‘The Man Who Fell To Earth’, the science fiction film that gave David Bowie his first major cinematic role, is to be shown in cinemas to mark its 40th anniversary.
