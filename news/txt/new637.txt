Fans and famous friends are paying tribute to Pete Burns on social media. His family announced this afternoon (October 23) that the Dead Or Alive frontman passed away after suffering a “massive cardiac arrest”. He was 57 years old. In a lengthy post on Instagram, Scissor Sisters frontman Jake Shears said of Burns: “You always elevated a room, whether in person or on the speakers..” What a true original, a treasure of a human being. Pete Burns was so talented, funny and kind. Brash and bold. "You either ride the wave or it'll just swallow you up. Ride the wave, babe." Some of my favorite advice anyone's given me. I feel so fortunate to have had the pleasure of sharing the stage and many laughs with this true rock star… you will be absolutely missed, Pete. Thank you for the tunes and the fun times. You always elevated a room, whether in person or on the speakers..

However, their best-known song by far was ‘You Spin Me Round (Like A Record)’, which made Number One in March 1985 after a 17-week climb to the top of the charts. It was the first Number One single produced by the Stock Aitken Waterman “hit factory” who would go on to dominate British pop later in the decade. It became a Top Five hit again in 2006 after Burns appeared on Celebrity Big Brother, where he finished fifth. Celebrity Big Brother gave Burns, who was known for his sharp tongue, flamboyant dress sense and love of cosmetic surgery, a second career as a popular and often caustic TV personality.
