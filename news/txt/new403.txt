Meanwhile, Drake recently declared his love for Rihanna while on stage at the MTV VMAs, saying that he’s been “in love” with the singer for seven years. “She’s someone I’ve been in love with since I was 22 years old,” the 29-year-old said. “She’s one of my best friends in the world. All my adult life I’ve looked up to her even though she’s younger than me.” Upon accepting the award, Rihanna dedicated the honour and her success to both those closest to her and her fans. “This success is not my own: it’s my family’s, it’s my fans, it’s my country’s, it’s the Caribbean as a whole, it’s women, it’s black women,” she said. “So many people feel like their little piece is such a major part of this puzzle and I have to thank you guys for supporting me over and over.”
