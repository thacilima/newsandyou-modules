Watch Paul McCartney perform at a private fundraiser for Hillary Clinton
Paul McCartney performed at a private outdoor fundraiser for the US Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton last night (August 30). The Beatle appeared at the allegedly $25,000-a-ticket event along with the rock band Bon Jovi and musician Jimmy Buffett, both of whom joined McCartney in a rendition of ‘Hey Jude’ to close the evening’s entertainment. As reported by Uproxx, McCartney performed a four-song set: opening with the Wings song ‘Jet’, he then played ‘Can’t Buy Me Love’ and ‘Lady Madonna’ before wrapping up his time on stage with ‘Hey Jude’. Despite only playing a few songs, reports suggest that the show went on for 75 minutes. Watch fan-shot footage of a snippet of the ‘Hey Jude’ performance below via TV host Andy Cohen. Sir Paul, JBJ & Buffett bring it home for Bill and Hillary tonight! #ImWithHer A video posted by Andy Cohen (@bravoandy) on Aug 30, 2016 at 8:19pm PDT Various reports from the night also indicate that McCartney declared that he’d officially funded Clinton’s campaign, telling the audience from the stage that “this is the first time that I’ve paid to hear myself sing” – most likely referring to the fact that he’d donated to her campaign to become US President. Clinton’s husband and former US President Bill was also in attendance. Earlier this month, McCartney posted a picture with Clinton on his Twitter account, stating “she’s with me” – a play on the Clinton campaign slogan. She's with me. pic.twitter.com/vHPMHMjFvV — Paul McCartney (@PaulMcCartney) August 17, 2016
