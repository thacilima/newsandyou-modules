Jamie T loses out to country duo and The Carpenters for No 1 album
Country duo Ward Thomas have beaten Jamie T to No 1, becoming the first British country music act to have a No 1 album. Hampshire sisters Catherine and Lizzy Ward-Thomas’ second album ‘Cartwheels’ comfortably eclipsed the No 41 peak of their 2014 debut ‘Where We Stand’. Jamie T’s new album ‘Trick’ has had to settle for No 3, with The Carpenters’ new compilation ‘The Nation’s Favourite Carpenters Songs’ entering at No 2. There are a total of 13 new entries in the Top 40 album chart this week, with Wretch 32’s ‘Growing Over Life’ becoming his second Top Five album at No 5. The other new entries are A Day To Remember (No 6), The Divine Comedy (7), Sophie Ellis-Bextor (12), Travis Scott (19), King Creosote (25), Izzy Bizu (28), Freddie Mercury (31), The Wedding Present (35) and Angel Olsen (40). On the singles chart, The Chainsmokers’ Halsey collaboration ‘Closer’ is No 1 for a second week, 12,000 sales ahead of DJ Snake’s Justin Bieber collaboration ‘Let Me Love You’ at No 2. After there were no new entries at all in the singles chart last week, there are seven this week. Ariana Grande’s Nicki Minaj collaboration ‘Side To Side’ is the highest new entry at No 24, followed by Zara Larsson (30), Offaiah (30), Matoma (35), Digital Farm Animals (36), Cheat Codes (38) and Mike Perry (39).
