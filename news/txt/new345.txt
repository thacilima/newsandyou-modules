Is this Calvin Harris-penned track a break-up song about Taylor Swift?
Calvin Harris has co-written ‘Olé’, the new single from singer John Newman and a track that many are speculating is a break-up song about Harris’ ex-girlfriend Taylor Swift. Swift and Harris dated from March 2015 until their split in June of this year. Swift has been rumoured to now be dating English actor Tom Hiddleston after they were kissing on a beach two weeks after her split with Harris. Newman’s song is thought to be written from the perspective of someone’s secret lover. The opening lyrics, “Low key, you won’t tell none of your friends about me”, have been seen by some as a reference to Loki, Hiddleston’s character in the Thor films. The lyrics continue, “I see online that you’ve begun to be / A good girl and take trips with your boyfriend / Being attentive, continue to pretend”, which fans have taken as another reference to Swift and Hiddleston, who have been seen together on various trips in their short relationship to date. However, TMZ reports that a source close to Swift insists that she was aware of the song and that it precedes her break-up with Harris. Listen to ‘Olé’ below.
