Listen to a new version of James Blake’s ‘Timeless’ featuring Vince Staples
James Blake has shared a new version of his song ‘Timeless’, featuring vocals from the rapper Vince Staples. The song originally featured on Blake’s recent third album ‘The Colour In Anything’, with the songwriter being the sole artist credited. Blake has now released an updated version of the song, which is nearly half the length of the original and features Staples on lead vocals. The song received its premiere last night (September 1) on Annie Mac’s show on BBC Radio 1, and is now available to stream and buy. Listen to the song via YouTube or Spotify below. The duo performed the new collaboration for the first time back in June during Blake’s headline performance on the West Holts stage at Glastonbury. The 27-year-old, who went up against Adele in terms of the timing of his set, also welcomed Bon Iver‘s Justin Vernon on stage during the show. This isn’t the first time that Blake and the Long Beach rapper have worked together, as the former produced two of the tracks on Staples’ most recent EP ‘Prima Donna’, which came out at the end of August. Staples will also support Blake on select dates of his US tour, which starts later this month (September 23) in Dallas. Blake will tour the UK and Ireland this autumn – see those dates below.
