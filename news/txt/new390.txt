Rhian Daly, 6th July 2016 Related Articles The Strokes announce LA show to support homeless charities Watch The Strokes' surreal new video for 'Threat Of Joy' The Strokes' Julian Casablancas says most bands don't like playing festivals The Strokes have clarified why ticket prices are higher than usual for their LA benefit show. The band will play The Wiltern venue on July 25 at the City Of Angels Benefit Concert. The gig will support and raise funds for three local nonprofit organisations - The Center in Hollywood, Waste Not Want Not Now, and the Downtown Women's Centre. Each group support's the city's homeless community. Tickets for the show will cost $125 (£97) and go on sale tomorrow (July 7). "We've made the tickets more expensive than usual and wanted to explain why to those of you who might not be able to afford them," wrote the band on their Facebook page. "In doing a show for the charities - Waste Not Want Not Now, The Center in Hollywood, and Downtown Women's Center - our responsibility is to keep costs down and to ensure as much of the money goes to those in need. 100% of net proceeds of this show will be going to the charities. "Similarly, we have to acknowledge many tickets will appear on secondary sites within minutes of going on sale which means that anyone can flip a ticket and make a $50, $75, $100++ profit. None of that additional money would go to any of the charities but to scalpers, and it will happen at a regularly priced show." They added: "For those of you who might not be able to afford tickets and are disappointed we’re sorry but in this instance we made a decision to help the charities and prevent as much money being siphoned away from the people in need as we could."
