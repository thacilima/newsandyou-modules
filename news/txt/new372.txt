Is this the first track from Justice’s third album?
The first track from Justice‘s forthcoming third album could have been played at Sonar Festival. During the event’s Ed Banger House Party, the duo’s manager Busy P DJed b2b with label signees Para One and Boston Bun. One fan noticed an unknown opening song when the set was posted online and tried to find out what it was. They Shazamed the track with the results crediting it as an untitled song by Justice. As Ministry Of Sound reports, when you now Shazam the song it shows the title as ‘Safe And Sound’ and features artwork that could belong to their third record. Xavier de Rosnay and Gaspard Auge have already confirmed the follow-up to 2011’s ‘Audio, Video, Disco’ will be released in 2016.
