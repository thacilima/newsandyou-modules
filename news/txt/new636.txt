Fans slam Drake for dissing Kid Cudi in new song while he’s in rehab
Music fans have reacted angrily to Drake‘s new song, ‘Two Birds, One Stone’, which sees the Toronto rapper criticise Kid Cudi. The two artists have had their disagreements in the past, with Cudi specifically calling out Drake in a series of tweets about “the fake ones” back in September. However, Drake’s latest jibe at Cudi has elicited an angry response from fans online, considering that Cudi checked himself into rehab earlier this month for ‘depression and suicidal urges’. As Pigeons and Planes reports, Drake released four new tracks today (October 24) to celebrate his 30th birthday, all of which will feature on his upcoming project, ‘More Life’. However, the lyrical content on ‘Two Birds, One Stone’ has upset many fans of Cudi, with the lines “You were the man on the moon / Now you just go through your phases / Life of the angry and famous” causing controversy: “the man on the moon” remark referring to the title of Cudi’s first two albums, 2009’s ‘Man on the Moon: The End of Day’ and ‘Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager’, released in 2010. Many fans have taken issue with the lyrics, especially given the recent timing of Cudi’s public announcement of his struggles with depression – see a selection of the social media reaction below. Drake just reinforced the black stigma that mental illness is a weakness, a flaw and not the disease it is.
