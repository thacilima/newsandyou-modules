Barbra Streisand beats Britney Spears to No 1 album
Barbra Streisand has beaten Britney Spears to No 1 in the album chart, with Spears’ first album for three years having to settle for the runner-up spot. Spears has never had a British No 1 album, with her albums ‘Baby One More Time’ (1999), ‘Oops I Did It Again’ (2000) and ‘Blackout’ (2007) also reaching No 2, as did her hits compilation ‘My Prerogative’ in 2004. The No 2 new entry for Spears’ latest album ‘Glory’ is significantly better than that for her previous album ‘Britney Jean’, which reached No 34 in 2013. Streisand’s new album ‘Encore’, consisting of duets with Broadway musicians, is the singer’s seventh No 1 album. Madonna is the only female solo artist with more British No 1 albums, having achieved 12. Kylie Minogue and Celine Dion are in joint third place with five. Elsewhere in the album chart, De La Soul are new at No 16 with ‘And The Anonymous Nobody’, their best position since ‘Is Dead’ reached No 7 in 1991. The other Top 40 new entry is by New Model Army at No 25 with ‘Winter’, their best position since ‘The Love Of Hopeless Causes’ reached No 22 in 1993. On the singles chart, Chainsmokers climb two places to No 1 with ‘Closer’, replacing Major Lazer, whose Justin Bieber and MO collaboration ‘Cold Water’ had five weeks on top. There are precisely no new entries in the Top 40 singles chart, two months after the same feat occurred in July. Meanwhile, Calvin Harris’ Rihanna collaboration ‘This Is What You Came For’ has been revealed as the most streamed song in Britain this summer by Google Play. Drake’s ‘One Dance’ was named as the most streamed song in the world in the same May 30-August 25 period by the streaming service.
