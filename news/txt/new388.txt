The VH1 Hip-Hop Honours hasn’t taken place for six years and makes its return for the first time since 2010 this year. Tupac Shakur, Russell Simmons and Public Enemy have all been honoured in the past. Earlier this year, it was announced that Elliott had teamed up with Fall Out Boy to put a new spin on Ray Parker, Jr’s famous ‘Ghostbusters’ theme song. The two camps’ version of the track features on the soundtrack for the Ghostbusters remake, which is released on July 15.
