Hear Cyndi Lauper liken Donald Trump to Hitler during a radio interview
Cyndi Lauper has expressed her disdain for controversial Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump by likening his “inflammatory” comments to those made by Adolf Hitler. Lauper appeared alongside Trump on the US version of The Apprentice back in 2010, but noted in a radio interview earlier today (September 2) that “a reality show is not credential to be President”. Speaking on San Diego’s Morning News, Billboard reports, the singer told listeners: “The things that he says are appalling to me and shocking. I was so shocked when he started to talk about the LGBT community – when in fact, people working who did amazing work on his Celebrity Apprentice show were gay.” “And you don’t talk about your employees like that, ever,” she insisted. After becoming more animated and branding Trump’s recent comments “racist” and “sexist”, Lauper added: “No matter what his daughter says, it has nothing to do with what that guy is selling. That guy is selling inflammatory things that I have never in my whole entire life heard… except, you know, Hitler. But you know, I don’t know what to say – it’s pretty shocking.” Listen to Lauper’s comments on Trump here. Lauper released her latest album, country collection ‘Detour’ in June, and supported the release with a UK tour including her first ever appearance at Glastonbury Festival.
