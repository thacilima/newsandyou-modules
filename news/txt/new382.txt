The list ended with a ban of Donald Trump supporters because “That’s basically three or four of the aforementioned topics”. Williams said that difference of opinion are healthy, but said: “In light of the constant rape, murder, homophobia, racism and misogyny that goes on seemingly everyday, I feel the need to make clear who I personally make music for and who I don’t.” The singer added that “Nobody’s perfect (including myself)”, but stated: “I’d rather have a room half-filled with good energy than one filled with hate”. Wavves, who released current album ‘V’ in 2015, start their bigotry-free US tour on July 21, ending on September 23.
