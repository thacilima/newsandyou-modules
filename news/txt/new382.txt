Wavves ban Donald Trump fans, racists and homophobes from their gigs
Wavves have banned Donald Trump supporters, racists and homophobes from their new tour. The band have produced a list of groups who will not be welcome at their shows, though they admit the ban will have to be self-policing. Singer Nathan Williams said he drew up the list because “People are suffering every day and, the way I see it, you’re either part of the solution or part of the problem”. https://twitter.com/wavves/status/750800122712174592 The Californian band’s banned groups of people includes “Anyone who has harboured resentment in any way towards the homosexual community in any way”; anyone who “thought a rape victim had it coming because she was dressed a certain way or was too intoxicated”’; those who supported the anti-abortion hashtag #alllivesmatter; white people who use racial slurs; and anyone who has “gone out of their way” to defend American police. The list ended with a ban of Donald Trump supporters because “That’s basically three or four of the aforementioned topics”. Williams said that difference of opinion are healthy, but said: “In light of the constant rape, murder, homophobia, racism and misogyny that goes on seemingly everyday, I feel the need to make clear who I personally make music for and who I don’t.” The singer added that “Nobody’s perfect (including myself)”, but stated: “I’d rather have a room half-filled with good energy than one filled with hate”. Wavves, who released current album ‘V’ in 2015, start their bigotry-free US tour on July 21, ending on September 23.
