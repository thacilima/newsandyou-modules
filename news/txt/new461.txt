Boxpark Croydon, a new pop-up mall from the creators of Boxpark Shoreditch, will open next month with a two-day music festival produced in partnership with NME and Eskimo Dance. Boxpark Croydon will house over 40 traders and have a capacity of 2,000 people, making it the biggest food and culture outlet of its kind. Food brands already confirmed for the new space in south London include MeatLiquor, Chilango, Mama Lan and Breakfast Club. Wiley’s Eskimo Dance collective will host the first day of the music festival on Saturday, October 29. As well as a set from Wiley himself, performances on the day will come from Ghetts, Novelist, Mistajam, Solo45 and Elf Kid, among others. Tickets begin at £15 per person and are available here. NME will host the second day of the music festival on Sunday, October 30. Rising stars A2, Alfa Mist, Barney Artist, Club Kuru, Nova Twins and Tailr.Mde.Lvn are all confirmed to perform, with more acts to be announced in due course. Tickets are free and fans can register their interest here. NME editor-in-chief Mike Williams said of the partnership with Boxpark Croydon: “At NME we’re passionate about championing emerging talent, grassroots scenes and the venues that nurture and support them. Partnering on the launch of this great new music space is the perfect opportunity for us to put that support into action. It’s an exciting event, and we’re proud to be a part of it.”
