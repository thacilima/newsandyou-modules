Britney Spears’ manager explains why her recent music video was canned
Britney Spears‘ manager has explained why the original version of the singer’s ‘Make Me’ video was never released. Renowned video director and photographer David LaChapelle originally directed the video for ‘Make Me’, the lead single from Spears’ latest album Glory, but the version that was eventually released is credited to a different director, Randee St. Nicholas. It was later reported that Spears, who previously worked with LaChapelle on the controversial video for her 2004 single ‘Everytime’, had rejected the original promo clip because it was allegedly “too sexy”. Footage from LaChapelle’s original ‘Make Me’ video has since leaked online. Dismissing these rumours, Spears’ manager Larry Rudolph told the Los Angeles Times: “It’s really simple. The [original] video just didn’t work. This is the first time we’ve re-shot a video, and because it’s Britney there are all kinds of conspiracies. Nobody is hiding anything.” Spears’ latest album ‘Glory’ has recently debuted at Number Two in the UK and Number Three in the US. On September 27, she will support the album with a one-off UK gig at London’s Roundhouse as part of this year’s Apple Music Festival, her first live appearance in the UK in five years.
