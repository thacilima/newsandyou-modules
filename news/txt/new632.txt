The Chemical Brothers to reissue classic albums on vinyl
The Chemical Brothers will make their entire album discography available on vinyl next month (November). The band’s 1999 album ‘Surrender’ and 2015 effort ‘Born In The Echoes’ are already available to purchase on vinyl. On November 18, their six other studio albums will all be reissued on vinyl in the UK. The band said on their website: “Each release features 180g heavyweight double LP vinyl re-packaged in the original sleeve pressing artwork. Audio has been cut from the original lacquers directly from the studio of the original engineer, Mike Marsh, and fully approved by The Chemical Brothers’ Ed Simons and Tom Rowlands.” In the US, the albums will be reissued on limited edition coloured vinyl on December 9, before being made available in standard black vinyl on December 23. Meanwhile, The Chemical Brothers will play a short series of UK live shows this December in support of their 2015 album ‘Born In The Echoes’. The tour kicks off at Glasgow’s SECC on December 7 with further dates at Blackpool’s Empress Ballroom on December 9 and London’s Eventim Apollo on December 10 and 11. Last year, The Chemical Brothers broke the record for most Number One albums by any dance act when ‘Born In The Echoes’ became their sixth record to top the UK charts.
