Has Frank Ocean been writing a novel while working on long-awaited second album?
Frank Ocean has reportedly been writing a novel while working on his much-anticipated follow-up to critically-acclaimed debut ‘Channel Orange’. ‘Channel Orange’ was released in July 2012, with the R&B musician’s second album – thought to be called ‘Boys Don’t Cry’ – expected at some point this month (July 2016). Ocean’s new album was initially expected to be released in 2015, but its delay has contributed to mass frenzy among fans. The star recently appeared in a Calvin Klein advert, with eagle-eyed Reddit users spotting an indicator of how Ocean might have been spending his time hidden amongst the source code of the Calvin Klein website. The source code features an introductory paragraph about Ocean, including the sentence, “He has published a magazine and worked on a novel while continuing to perfect his highly anticipated second album.” While a magazine called Boys Don’t Cry is expected to be published alongside his new album, Ocean told The Guardian in 2012 that he “might just write a novel next”. Ocean’s new album is thought to have been recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London. In March, Ocean’s producer Malay said that the album was “maybe a month away”. Ocean’s friend Chance The Rapper has said that he is “making a masterpiece”, while James Blake has worked on the album and has called it “better” than ‘Channel Orange’. In February this year new Frank Ocean music was leaked online, supposedly after a secret listening party. The untitled snippets were later removed due to copyright claims.
