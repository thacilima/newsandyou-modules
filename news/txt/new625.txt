Muse‘s ambitious plans for their next world tour have been revealed, with their director claiming that the band want to ‘levitate on magnets’. The Devonshire trio have recently come off the road from their huge ‘Drones’ world tour – which saw them not only headline Glastonbury but play a run of arenas and stadiums with an adventurous stage show that saw them perform ‘in the round’.
