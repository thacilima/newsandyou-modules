Lady Gaga responds to Glastonbury rumours and tour plans
Lady Gaga has responded to rumours that she’ll be performing at Glastonbury 2017, as well as what she has in store her upcoming tour plans. While Radiohead are the only confirmed headline act for Glastonbury 2017, Lady Gaga remains a strong rumour to appear too after it was said that she had been ‘approached’ by organisers. When NME asked her about said rumours, she refused to deny them when she replied: “Glaaaastonbury! I don’t have permission to say anything about that” – with her tight-lipped response suggesting that sworn to secrecy until an announcement. Read more: Glastonbury 2017 – who could be headlining? With regards to her more stripped-back recent live shows, Gaga added that future tour dates were likely to return to her more extravagant ways. “What I would say to those who are terrified that I’ll never again embrace absurdity or the avant-garde is ‘think again’,” she told NME. “Because that is my favourite thing.” Last week, Lady Gaga released her third album ‘Joanne’ – check out the full NME review and verdict here. She also spoke to NME about David Bowie’s son Duncan Jones’ criticism of her controversial tribute to The Thin White Duke at this year’s GRAMMYs. “I’m sure that was difficult to watch and of course, I called many people on David’s team before I even begun doing that project and it’s unfortunate, what can I say? But God bless of him, you know?” Speaking exclusively to NME, organiser Emily Eavis denied the rumours that Daft Punk and Stone Roses would be headlining Glastonbury 2017.
