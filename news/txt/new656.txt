Watch Blink-182 recreate classic ‘What’s My Age Again?’ video with naked women
Blink-182 have recreated their classic ‘What’s My Age Again?’ video in their new clip for ‘She’s Out Of Her Mind’. The band have teamed up with Spotify for this new video, which sees scenes re-enacted from their 1999 clip. Instead of the trio running naked, this updated version sees them replaced by three nude women and a male nurse (played by Adam Devine). Watch below. In July, the band released ‘California’, their seventh studio album. It is the first album by the band to feature vocalist/guitarist Matt Skiba, also the frontman of Alkaline Trio, who replaced founding member Tom DeLonge who left the band last year. The band recently revealed that they are planning to tour Europe by boat because drummer Travis Barker suffers from flight anxiety. He has been unable to travel with the band after a plane crash in 2008 resulted in him developing a fear of flying. Speaking about their hopes to overcome Travis’ phobia, Mark Hoppus said: “We are looking into it. Hopefully we can make it work. Travis is looking into the possibility of taking a boat from LA, which is a very long trip.” Meanwhile, despite their long and fractured break up, ex Blink-182 frontman DeLonge has said that he isn’t done with the band. Posting on Facebook in April, he said: “I understand all the craziness out there in Internet-land, it is an odd time for fans of the Blink-182 legacy, I know – it’s odd for me, too. ” “We DO have a future together if we want it, but for now we are busy doing separate things. I look forward to my upcoming film and music adventures, and a hell of a lot more. Maybe throw in a bit of Blink-182, if we can build back that ‘special something’ that was once there?”
