Blood Orange calls Devendra Banhart’s music ‘insufferable’ then vows to delete Twitter
Blood Orange aka Devonté Hynes reportedly called Devendra Banhart’s music “insufferable” last night (August 31) before telling fans he intended to delete Twitter. Pitchfork reports that Hynes wrote in a tweet that has since been deleted: “The music of devandra banhart is so insufferable I feel sorry for the entirety of Los Angeles, you deserve better.” Asked by a fan, “What exactly is the point of being so insufferably rude?”, presumably in response to the now-deleted tweet, Hynes replied by simply writing: “Happiness”. https://twitter.com/devhynes/status/771089386020622336 He then told fans, cryptically: “You should all know by now that I don’t attack people for no reason…” https://twitter.com/devhynes/status/771089529541320704 In subsequent tweets, Hynes said that “me not liking someone’s music is not news lol” before telling his followers that he was “deleting Twitter so I can enjoy my life”. However, at the time of writing his account remains active. https://twitter.com/devhynes/status/771115407683887104 Hynes released his second album as Blood Orange earlier this summer.
