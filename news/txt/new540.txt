Slaves release video for new song ‘Take Control
Slaves have released a video for new single ‘Take Control’, the title track from their new album set to be released on September 30. This track will be released as a limited 7″ with “We Are The England” by Wonk Unit acting as the B Side. The video is inspired by the old school vibes of VHS tapes and sees Isaac Holman and Laurie Vincent riding around on a tandem with a boombox. Slaves are also embarking on two-month long trek around the UK and recently revealed that they are following the example set out by The Cribs when it comes to touring. “We want to be able to do everything, I think it’s important to do the small shows and the big shows to maintain the balance. Don’t forget where you come from. The Cribs are the model band, I can’t say we made any of these ideas up ourselves, they did all that stuff,” Laurie Vincent told Dork. Vincent and his bandmate Isaac Holman are planning to perform in a mixture of tiny local venues and institutions like London’s Shepherds Bush Empire during their thirty date tour.
