Flying Lotus-directed short film to premiere at Sundance NEXT FEST
Flying Lotus is premiering a short film he directed at a film festival next month. Titled Royal, the film will be the directorial debut of the L.A. producer. It is credited to one of his aliases, “steve”. The short will be shown as part of Sundance NEXT FEST, a film and music festival which takes place August 12-14 at The Theatre at Ace Hotel Downtown Los Angeles. Six new independent films from the 2016 Sundance Film Festival will be screened at the festival “paired with a music act, live performance, or conversation with an icon of independent cinema.” My first thing is called "Royal" it's an awkward love story that's definitely not for the kiddies. It will debut at the Sundance /Next fest — FLYLO (@flyinglotus) July 6, 2016 Shamir will also perform at this year’s event alongside a screening of So Yong Kim’s Lovesong, which stars Jena Malone and Riley Keough. Last year, Flying Lotus scored a short film, FUCKKKYOUUU, which premiered at Sundance. The producer recently courted controversy after speaking out about the treatment of his peers by rappers. “To producers,” he wrote on Twitter. “When a rapper invites u to the studio and asks u to make beats on the spot. Tell them to pay your fee on the spot, cuz fuck that.”
