For The Person Still Playing Pokémon Go: Here’s What’s New For Halloween
Anyone still playing Pokémon Go? No? Well here’s a reason you might want to get back into it over Halloween: there are loads more Drowsees about. And Zubats. And Gastlys. Wait, come back! Gengars too, apparently! Yes, this is the news that Pokémon Go will be undergoing some kind of Halloween event, the details for which have yet to be made entirely clear, but there are a few things you need to know. Things like this: Candy is what you use to level up Pokémon in Pokémon Go, but handily for game creator Niantic, it’s also what you trick-or-treat for at Halloween. So for the days between October 26 and November 1 you’ll get more candy whenever you catch, hatch or transfer Pokémon. If you deleted Pokémon Go a while ago you’ll have missed the Buddy update, which allows you to select a Pokémon as a buddy. Whichever buddy you select will earn their type of candy whenever you walk around with them – and during Halloween, you’ll get their type of candy four times as much. These are: Zubat, Golbat, Gastly, Haunter, Gengar, Drowsee and Hypno. Gengar isn’t something you see around a lot, but you’ll probably have seen all of the others several times – so this one’s not a huge deal, really. Then again, you’ll get loads more of their type of candy over Halloween by catching and transferring them – that could be useful.
