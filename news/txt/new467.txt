Chris Brown ‘tested for drugs’ in jail
Chris Brown was reportedly tested for drugs following his recent arrest. Police sources claim the rapper gave up a blood sample in jail last night (August 30), according to TMZ. Earlier today, Brown was released from police custody after a bail of $250,000 (£190k) was posted. The singer has been accused of threatening a woman with a gun during a party at his home and was arrested following a stand-off with police. Following news of his release, Brown’s attorney Mark Geragos took to Twitter to describe the allegations as “demonstrably false”, tweeting: “Thanks to everyone for their support and well wishes. Chris is out and well. The allegations against him are demonstrably false #TeamBreezy”. Brown is now due to appear in court on September 20.

Police later arrived at the property, where they were thrown a duffel bag of weapons (including one gun) and drugs by Brown from his window, where he taunted officers, saying “come get me.” As police were in the process of obtaining a search warrant for the property, Brown emerged from his home once his lawyer had arrived at the scene. Before he threw the bag out of the window, Brown posted a series of now-deleted videos to his Instagram addressing the incident and its subsequent fall-out. Claiming that he’d just woken up to find officers surrounding his house, Brown protested his innocence – as well as saying that the authorities wouldn’t find anything in a house search – before voicing his support for the Black Lives Matter movement and then declaring “fuck the police.” He also claimed that the media attention surrounding the incident at his house is actually helping promote his name and music.
