Blink-182 score their first UK No 1 album
Blink-182 have scored their first No 1 album in Britain, 21 years since the release of their debut. Having released their debut album ‘Cheshire Cat’ in 1995, the trio’s new album ‘California’ has dethroned Adele’s ‘25’ from the top spot. The band told compilers Official Charts Company: “We’re so excited and thankful to be No 1 in the UK. We’re super thankful to all of you for supporting us.” Blink-182’s previous highest charting album was ‘Take Off Your Pants And Jacket’, which reached No 4 in 2001. That same album is currently their only US No 1. Bat For Lashes is the next-highest new entry, with ‘The Bride’ entering at No 9, followed by Metronomy’s ‘Summer 08’ at No 20. The other Top 40 new entry is Area 11, whose ‘Modern Synthesis’ is at No 27. On the singles chart, Drake is at No 1 for a 13th week with ‘One Dance’. It leaves Kungs Vs Cookin’ On 3 Burners’ ‘That Girl’ at No 2 for a fourth week, having been ahead in the midweek charts for the past three weeks. The top four singles are the same as last week, with Drake’s ‘Too Good’ at No 3 and Calvin Harris’ ‘This Is What You Came For’ at four. The only change in the Top Five sees Adele’s ‘Send My Love To Your New Lover’ climb one place to five. There are two new entries in the singles Top 40. Rihanna’s ‘Needed Me’ is at No 38 and MK, aka veteran house producer Marc Kinchen, is at No 40 with Becky Hill collaboration ‘Piece Of Me’.
