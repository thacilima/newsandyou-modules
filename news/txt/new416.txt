System Of A Down trigger speculation about new music after posting in-the-studio pictures
System Of A Down appear to be back playing together in the studio. The veteran heavy metal band, who hail from California, haven’t released an album since 2005’s ‘Hypnotize’, yet they have regularly played together live in the intervening years. They last performed in the UK in April 2015 with a show at London’s Wembley Arena. As Metal Injection observes, three of the band’s four members have posted pictures of themselves playing together in a studio over the past two days. Bassist Shavo Odadjian started the speculation yesterday by posting a picture of himself in a rehearsal studio with drummer John Dolmayan behind his kit, captioning the post “1..2..3..4.. #systemofadown #letdothis”. While this triggered much discussion about the possibility of new music among the band’s fanbase, the excitement was increased earlier today by the added presence of guitarist Daron Malakian in the studio, a moment captured on Dolmayan’s Instagram. See the two posts, as well as Dolmayan’s latest picture from the rehearsals, below. 4.3.2.1….. :). #systemofadown #letsdothis A photo posted by Shavo O (@shavoodadjian) on Aug 31, 2016 at 6:47pm PDT 1..2..3..4.. #systemofadown #letdothis A photo posted by John Dolmayan (@realjohndolmayan) on Aug 31, 2016 at 6:17pm PDT #systemofadown #soad #letsdothis A photo posted by John Dolmayan (@realjohndolmayan) on Sep 1, 2016 at 6:56pm PDT Notably, vocalist Serj Tankian is absent in all three pictures – with some fans asking Dolmayan where he is. “Where the fuck is Serj. But fuck it, if you take Daron’s voice it will be perfect,” wrote one fan.
