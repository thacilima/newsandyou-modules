Jay Z ‘to throw pro-Clinton gig in swing state of Cleveland’
Jay Z is to stage a pro-Hillary Clinton concert in Cleveland before next month’s election, according to a report. The rapper’s pro-Clinton gig will be “aimed at mobilizing black voters” in the swing state, BuzzFeed News reports. A date for the concert has yet to be set, but three sources are said to have tipped off BuzzFeed News that it will definitely be happening. The US election pitting Clinton against Donald Trump takes place on November 8. Both Jay Z and wife Beyoncé have already endorsed Clinton for the presidency. Meanwhile, Jay Z has been nominated for entry to the Songwriters Hall of Fame. The prestigious organisation, whose mission is to “preserve, honour and celebrate the legacy of the great songwriters whose work has enriched the world’s culture”, will announce the new slate of accepted artists at their Annual Induction & Awards Gala on June 15, 2017 in New York City. Jay Z becomes the first rapper to be recognised in this manner by the organisation. As The Guardian reports, songwriters become eligible for induction into the Hall of Fame after having a songwriting career that spans at least 20 years. This year, 2016, marks the 20th anniversary of Jay Z’s debut album, ‘Reasonable Doubt’. Other nominees on the 2017 list include Madonna, Cat Stevens and George Michael. Members of the organisation can vote for two performing songwriters and three non-performing songwriters who they believe should be inducted into the Hall of Fame next year, with voting closing on 16 December. A total of five artists will be inducted at next year’s Awards Gala.
