Watch Mel C join MØ for performance of Spice Girls’ ‘Say You’ll Be There’
Mel C joined MØ on stage in London last night (October 22) to perform the Spice Girls hit ‘Say You’ll Be There’. MØ released a cover of the single in 2014 and treated the crowd at London’s Roundhouse to a performance of it during her encore. Before the performance, MØ wrote on Instagram: “Only one show left on my UK tour and it’s my biggest ever!!! I’m FREAKING OUT but I try to keep it cool (lol it’s not working) SO EXCITED FOR TONIGHT.” You can watch footage of the performance below. After the performance, Mel C shared an image of the pair on Instagram, writing: “Tonight I had the honour of sharing a stage @roundhouseldn with this incredible woman @momomoyouth she slayed #songs #vocals #energy #attitude She was inspired by the Spice Girls as a kid now she inspires me” Earlier this year, Melanie C explained why she turned down the chance to participate in a proposed Spice Girls reunion. “Truth be told, earlier this year after several face-to-face meetings with the girls I made the difficult decision not to be part of a proposed reunion with Emma, Geri and Melanie,” Chisholm writes in an article for Love Magazine. “Victoria had already bowed out understandably with the demands of her fashion label and her rather large family. The hardest part for me was letting people down, the girls, the fans, civilisation?! Unfortunately something didn’t feel quite right and I had to follow my gut.” “I’d love to play huge arenas across the World, sing our brilliantly bonkers pop songs and relive our former glory,” Chisholm continues. “It is of course a very lucrative opportunity too. But we were a five-piece band. Didn’t we reach a peak with the Olympics? There’s a lot to be said for bowing out on a high note.”
