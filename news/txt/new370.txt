David Bowie’s ‘The Man Who Fell To Earth’ to be shown in cinemas to mark 40th anniversary
The science fiction film that gave David Bowie his first major cinematic role is to be shown in cinemas to mark its 40th anniversary. The Man Who Fell To Earth was released in 1976 and featured Bowie as an alien called Thomas Jerome Newtown who came to Earth to take water back to his drought-ridden planet. A 4k restoration of the film will be shown in cinemas across England on September 9, according to Pitchfork. STUDIOCANAL, who restored the film, will also release it on DVD and Blu-ray in the UK on October 10. It is also expected to be released in the US and Germany too. Last month, a lock of Bowie’s hair sold for £13,700 at an auction in Beverly Hills. The hair was taken by Wendy Farrier, who cut a small piece of Bowie’s hair in 1983 to be used for his waxwork at Madame Tussauds in London. She kept a lock of it in a frame for 33 years, before passing it on to auction house Heritage Auctions.
