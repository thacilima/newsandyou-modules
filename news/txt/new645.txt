Britney Spears experiences “wardrobe malfunction” in Las Vegas – watch
Britney Spears experienced a wardrobe malfunction during her Las Vegas residency show on Saturday night (October 22). The singer was performing her cover of ‘I Love Rock N’ Roll’ when her bra-top failed to fasten properly at the collar. She was forced to keep it up with her hands, preventing her from committing fully to the song’s dance routine. She made it through the performance, but the bra-top was still causing her problems during next song ‘Gimme More’. One of her dancers then gave her the shirt off his back so she could continue the rest of the routine in comfort. Last month (September) Spears took a break from her Vegas show to travel to London for her first UK gig in five years. She performed all of her greatest hits including ‘…Baby One More Time’, ‘Toxic’ and ‘Gimme More’ during her 90-minute set at the intimate Roundhouse venue. Read the NME review here. The pop icon, who dropped ninth album ‘Glory’ last month, recently told NME that she has stopped being a “people pleaser” with her music. “Honestly, this is the first project where I’ve really been hands-on,” she said of ‘Glory’. “I was really specific about who I worked with, and I’ve been learning to say no. I’m a people pleaser, so that’s hard for me. Even if I don’t like something, I’ll do it just to make a person happy. I made sure this album was everything I wanted it to be. I was really selfish with it.”
