Watch Prince’s old band The Revolution play reunion concert after 30 years
Prince’s former backing band The Revolution have played their first reunion concert following Prince’s death. After Prince died in April, The Revolution vowed to reform in his honour. They are playing three shows at the First Avenue club in Minneapolis, where Purple Rain was filmed. The first show last night (September 1) featured Bilal as special guest on ‘The Beautiful Ones’, as The Revolution played versions of Prince classics including ‘Purple Rain’, ‘Let’s Go Crazy’ and ‘Little Red Corvette’. Whoa! The Revolution at First Ave. No words.☔️ A video posted by Nic.

The Revolution formed in 1979 when Prince wanted to copy Sly Stone’s band The Family Stone, initially as a side-project. They backed Prince on tour from 1980, formally becoming The Revolution in time for Prince’s album ‘1999’ in 1982. They then backed Prince on his albums ‘Purple Rain’, ‘Around The World In A Day’ and ‘Parade’ before disbanding in 1986. At the time, they were unhappy with extra musicians Prince had recruited. Wendy And Lisa went on to have solo success, while Bobby Z also released a self-titled solo album in 1989. Fink played with Prince until he was fired in 1991. The Revolution reformed without Prince for charity shows in 2003 and 2012, while Prince played with Wendy And Lisa in 2006 at the Brit Awards.
