Tupac Shakur restaurant to open on 20th anniversary of rapper’s death
A pop up Tupac Shakur-themed cafe is to open in Califonia to mark the 20th anniversary of the rapper’s death next week. The Powamekka Cafe, which takes its name and menu items from sketches the rap star once created for a cookbook and restaurant, will open next Tuesday (September 13) at the Fulton Mall in Fresno. The sketches are currently on display at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles. Items on the menu will include a California Love Chicken Sandwich, Hennessy Apple Butter chicken wings, mac-and-cheeseburger and Thug Passion cake pops featuring champagne cake with Alize liqueur-flavoured frosting. A host of local musicians will also perform a series of Tupac songs on the opening night. Take 3 Burgers is partnering with Fresno Grizzlies Marketing Director Sam Hansen to create the Powamekka Cafe. Hansen has previously worked with Kanye West, creating designs and merchandise. “Working on Powamekka Café makes me feel like I’m bringing Pac’s vision to life like I used to do for Kanye,” Hansen told The Business Journal. The idea for the Tupac pop-up restaurant came from a previous collaboration between Hansen and Desirae Washington-Reed of Take 3 Burgers. The restaurant hosted a tribute breakfast for Notorious B.I.G. on his birthday this year, taking inspiration from lyrics to his song ‘Big Poppa’ and serving a T-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch’s grape juice. Meanwhile, Johnny Depp is set to play a detective trying to solve the murders of Shakur and Notorious BIG in a new film based on their killings. Tupac was shot dead in Las Vegas in 1996. He appeared at Coachella in hologram form alongside Snoop Dogg in 2012.
