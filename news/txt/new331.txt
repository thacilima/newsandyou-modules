Led Zeppelin’s publishers seeking almost £500k in legal fees after ‘Stairway To Heaven’ trial win
Led Zeppelin‘s publishing company are seeking $613,000 (£470,000) for the legal fees incurred during the recent ‘Stairway To Heaven’ trial. It was announced last month that Led Zeppelin had won their copyright infringement lawsuit after a jury deemed that the band did not plagiarise Spirit’s song ‘Taurus’. The band were accused of copying part of the 1968 song in a case brought to court by Michael Skidmore, a trustee for the late Randy California (real name Randy Wolfe), who played guitar in US rock band Spirit, who had toured with Led Zeppelin in 1968 and 1969. Courthouse News now reports that Warner/Chappell Music filed for the reimbursement of legal fees on Thursday (July 7). They also labelled defence lawyer Francis Malofiy’s conduct in the trial as being in a “flagrantly unprofessional and offensive manner”. Malofiy has reportedly since been suspended from practising law.
