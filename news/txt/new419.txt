Listen to Slaves’ cover of The Streets’ ‘Fit But You Know It’
Slaves have covered The Streets’ ‘Fit But You Know It’ for a live session on BBC Radio 1. Performing on the station on Tuesday night (August 30), the Tunbridge Wells duo played a short, three-song set that included their new single ‘Spit It Out’. They were accompanied by Wolf Alice drummer Joel Amey for the duration of the performance. To close their session with Annie Mac, the band opted to do a cover of The Streets ‘Fit But You Know It’. The song was originally released in 2004, and featured on the Mike Skinner-led act’s second album ‘A Grand Don’t Come for Free’. The band also performed their new song ‘People That You Meet’ for the first time, which will feature on their forthcoming second album ‘Take Control’. Listen to the full set below – ‘People That You Meet’ starts at 7:10, while ‘Fit But You Know It’ begins at 18:40. Slaves’ cover of The Streets maintains their fondness for covering songs live – the duo notably do a cover version of Skepta‘s ‘Shutdown’, which they played at their secret set at Reading Festival last weekend. ‘Fit But You Know It’ has also been covered before – The Futureheads notably remade the song as a B-side for the original single version. Listen to it below.
