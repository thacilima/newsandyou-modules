No, I tried to listen to all the reports and shit and I tried my best to stop trying,” he began. “But I just couldn’t do it! I couldn’t stop! No matter what they write, I just couldn’t stop! I appreciate y’all going on this journey for me. I appreciate all the years y’all put up with me learning in front of you and listening to the music at the same time. “I appreciate the moment when Carine [Roitfeld] put her friend on the cover — no, not this moment — I’m talking about when she put Tom Ford on the cover. And all you motherfuckers were like, ‘Oh, Carine (is) over!’ She’s a motherfucking icon, though. There’s only one Carine.” West then dropped the mic and walked off stage.
