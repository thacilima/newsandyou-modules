Watch Red Hot Chili Peppers get naked in new ‘Go Robot’ video
Red Hot Chili Peppers have spoofed Saturday Night Fever in the video for their new single ‘Go Robot’. The video sees singer Anthony Kiedis wear nothing but white body white paint as he visits locations that were used in the original 1977 disco movie. As Kiedis eventually dons a codpiece, shoes, gloves and a hat, the singer eats pizza and goes clubbing. ‘Go Robot’ is directed by Tota Lee. The video sees all four band members credited under aliases. Kiedis is credited as Cole Dammett, the alias he used when he was a child actor, while Flea uses his real first names Michael Peter. Drummer Chad Smith also uses his real first names Chadwick Gaylord, while guitarist Josh Klinghoffer is listed as JK Dashwood. ‘Go Robot’ is the second single from current album ‘The Getaway’, following ‘Dark Necessities’.
