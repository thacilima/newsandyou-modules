Prince’s ex-girlfriend tells of late star’s alleged ‘cocaine diet’
An ex-girlfriend of late music icon Prince has described his alleged “cocaine diet” that she says he hid from her. Prince died in April of this year, with his cause of death later revealed to be an accidental overdose of the painkiller fentanyl. Charlene Friend, 44, dated Prince for two years from 1989. In 2003, Friend sued Prince for defamation and emotional distress, with Prince winning what was deemed a “spiteful lawsuit”. Speaking to People Magazine, Friend says that while she never witnessed the singer take drugs, she was told by his half-brother Duane Nelson that his hard work and stamina came from his so-called “cocaine diet”. Nelson died in 2013. “It was shocking to me to hear that,” Friend added. “He hid it so carefully. I never saw him take even an aspirin. He seemed so health-conscious, always taking vitamins like echinacea and goldenseal.” Friend also claims to have heard rumours that of Prince “taking pills to come down” after concerts. “Nothing could match the highs he got from his shows. Coming down afterwards made him feel empty. Perhaps drugs filled that void,” she alleges. While saying that she “wants to respect his memory,” Friend went on to say: “There were no grey areas [with Prince]. One day he would be in a good mood, and the next day he would be in this very deep, dark mood.” “Part of that was just his personality, but I now realise that the drugs enhanced that.” Prince’s estate has not yet responded to the claims.
