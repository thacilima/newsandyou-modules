Freddie Mercury honoured with a blue plaque at his family’s first home
Freddie Mercury‘s first home in the UK has been decorated with an English Heritage Blue Plaque in his honour. The singer’s sister Kashmira Cooke and his Queen bandmate Brian May unveiled the blue plaque today (September 1) at the inter-war terrace house in Feltham, west London that Mercury’s parents moved into when they emigrated from Zanzibar in 1964. Kashmira Cooke said at the unveiling ceremony today: “Mum and I are so proud and pleased that English Heritage is honouring our Freddie with a Blue Plaque, and that he will be amongst other famous names for ever. Secretly he would have been very proud and pleased too.” Mercury, who passed away in 1991, would have celebrated his 70th birthday this coming Monday, September 5. “It is a pleasant duty to help install this little reminder on Freddie’s parents’ house in Feltham,” Brian May said at the unveiling ceremony today. “It was here that I first visited Freddie soon after we had met through a mutual friend. We spent most of the day appreciating and analysing in intimate detail the way that Jimi Hendrix had put his recordings together in the studio – listening to Hendrix on vinyl played on Freddie’s Dansette record player – which had stereo speakers on opposite sides of the box! The unveiling ceremony today was also attended by the Secretary of State for Culture, Karen Bradley, who hailed Mercy as a “global icon whose music touched the lives of millions of people around the world.”
