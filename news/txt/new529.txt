Jimmy Page to appear on Later With Jools Holland
Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page has joined the line-up of guests for the new series of BBC2’s Later With Jools Holland. Page joins the first episode, which stars the previously announced Kings Of Leon, Jack White, M83, Banks and Sting. The guitarist won’t be performing on the show, instead discussing the newly-expanded Led Zeppelin album ‘Complete BBC Sessions’ which is released next week (September 16). The show has announced further names for the new series. The second episode will feature Jamie T, Madness, Beth Orton, Gallant and Rag ‘N’ Bone Man. The show returns for its new series with the half-hour Later Live segment broadcast live at 10pm on BBC2 next Tuesday (September 13) before the full hour-long pre-recorded version goes out on Friday at 11:05pm. The first episode marks White’s return to playing live following his hiatus from touring announced last year, while this week’s NME cover stars Kings Of Leon will give the first preview of songs from next month’s new album ‘WALLS’. This series will be the 49th of Later, with next year marking both its 50th series and 25th anniversary since it began in 1992. Later has two seasons per year, with the spring one earlier in 2016 featuring performances by The Last Shadow Puppets, Iggy Pop, Underworld, Tame Impala and James Blake. It also saw the first major British TV performance by Christine And The Queens.
