Noel Gallagher on being asked for selfies: “I just tell them to go fuck themselves”
Noel Gallagher has revealed that he has no qualms about turning away fans who ask for a selfie. The former Oasis man explained in a new interview that he feels no need “to be nice to people because they dig my music”. Asked what he does when fans ask for a picture with him, Gallagher told Rolling Stone: “I just tell them to go fuck themselves. I’m not beholden to anybody with a camera phone. I don’t give a fuck if they think I’m an asshole, either. I say, ‘I’m fucking busy here buying underwear.”” “Some people get offended,” Gallagher conceded, “but I don’t live my life to have my picture taken by fans. I’m not asking them to buy records. They buy them because they like them.” READ MORE: Noel Gallagher’s 50 Funniest Quotes During the interview, Gallagher also shared his thoughts on rumours that brother Liam could be planning to reform Oasis without him.
