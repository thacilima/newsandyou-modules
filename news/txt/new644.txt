Tove Lo announces UK and European tour
Tove Lo has announced details of UK shows as part of her upcoming European ‘Lady Wood’ tour. The ‘Stay High’ and ‘Cool Girl’ Swedish pop sensation is set to release her second album and the follow-up to ‘Queen Of The Clouds’, ‘Lady Wood’ on Friday 28 October, and will be back on the road with a string of gigs around Europe in March and throughout 2017. Speaking to The Guardian about the honest, frank and openly sexual and explicit nature of many of her lyrics and videos, Love said: “I feel like I grew up in a place where nudity and sex is something natural and not shameful. Here [in the US] they’re like: ‘Oh, you’re a bad girl, aren’t you? You go against the rules.’ That’s not at all what I’m trying to say or do here. Press “It’s about just not feeling like it’s something bad. All of a sudden, I’m fighting this fight I didn’t know I needed to fight.” She added: “I feel like emotion is seen as a bad thing, where it should be the opposite. We just live like this, making ourselves smaller, to not bother each other. You’re not supposed to be too loud, and [there are] all these rules about how your emotional state should be, and it’s just – it doesn’t really make sense. That’s why we’re all bottled up to here with shit.” Tove Lo’s upcoming UK tour dates are below – with tickets on sale from 10am on Friday 28 October.
