Dolly Parton gives away her Glastonbury show with new album
Dolly Parton is giving away a live album of her performance at Glastonbury with her new studio album. Parton played in the Sunday afternoon “legends” slot on the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury in 2014, which included Parton rapping in the specially-written song ‘Mud Song’ for her show. The full 14-song performance, which included hits such as ‘Jolene’, ‘9 To 5’, ‘Islands In The Stream’ and ‘I Will Always Love You’, is now a live CD which is free with Parton’s new album ‘Pure And Simple’. Released on August 19, ‘Pure And Simple’ is Parton’s first album since ‘Blue Smoke’ reached No 2 in 2014 ad her 43rd in all. Parton said of the self-produced album: “”I may not be pure, but I’m as simple as they come. This new project is really special to me, because I’m taking my fans back to my roots. I feel like these songs have a pure, tender side and we didn’t go overboard with arrangements. I’m so glad we’ve teamed up with our friends at Sony to get this album out to the fans.” The album is Parton’s first for Sony’s country music imprint RCA Nashville. There are as yet no UK shows for ‘Pure And Simple’. The tracklist of ‘Pure And Simple’ is: ‘Pure And Simple’; ‘Say Forever You’ll Be Mine’; ‘Never Not Love You’; ‘Kiss It (And Make It All Better); ‘Can’t Be That Wrong’; ‘Outside Your Door’’; Tomorrow Is Forever’; ‘I’m Sixteen’; ‘Head Over Heels’; ‘Forever Love’; ‘Mama’; ‘Lovin’ You’.
