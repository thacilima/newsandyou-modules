Watch The Killers cover Bob Dylan’s ‘Blowin’ In The Wind’
The Killers covered ‘Blowin’ In The Wind’ during a recent live performance on the border of California and their home state of Nevada. The Las Vegas band tackled the Bob Dylan classic from 1963 during their set at the Annual Lake Tahoe Summit, an environmental conference hosted by Nevada Senator Harry Reid. Watch fan-shot footage below. Meanwhile, the band have announced that they will mark the 10-year anniversary of their second album ‘Sam’s Town’ with a special reissue and what they are calling a “two day extravaganza” in Las Vegas. The album will be reissued as a two-disc vinyl set featuring remastered recordings of the LP’s original tracks plus two bonus cuts: demo ‘Peace Of Mind’ and the Pet Shop Boys remix of ‘Read My Mind’. Pre-order it now. The band’s two-day event will take place at Sam’s Town Hotel and Gambling Hall in Las Vegas from September 30 to October 1. As well as performances from The Killers on both days, the event will also offer fans a Killers-themed tour of the city. The band’s bassist Mark Stoermer released his second solo album, ‘Dark Arts’, in August.
