The Anchoress joins nominees for Welsh Music Prize
The Anchoress has been added to the list of nominees for the Welsh Music Prize. The Anchoress is the alias of singer Catherine Anne Davies, whose debut album ‘Confessions Of A Romance Novelist’ features former Mansun singer Paul Draper. The Welsh Music Prize was created in 2011 by Radio 1 DJ Huw Stephens and promoter John Rostron. Previous winners have included Super Furry Animals, Gwenno and Future Of The Left. This year’s event is at Cardiff’s Depot on September 24, with tickets available here. The nominees are being announced one by one throughout the day before 8pm. Announced already so far are Cate Le Bon, Skindred, Alun Gaffey, Datblygu, Meilyr Jones, Simon Love, 9Bach and Swnami. Speaking about her nomination, The Anchoress told NME: “I’m incredibly honoured .The album gestated over a number of years in the studio, but the ideas and influences behind The Anchoress stem all the way back to my childhood.” The Anchoress, whose album is reissued with a second disc on vinyl and CD on October 14, added: “I grew up with a real sense of the importance of music to the Welsh identity and my family’s history. As the 1967 poem by Brian Harris says, it’s a privilege to be born with this ‘music in your blood/And with poetry in your soul’, and a privilege of another kind to have the album recognised among so many other great offerings from the motherland.” She plays a one-off show at London King’s Place on December 17. The judges for the prize are a panel of 12 experts including journalists, festival promoters, TV producers and musician Amy Wadge.
