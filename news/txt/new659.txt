Watch Justin Bieber storm off stage as he tells crowd ‘Manchester can’t handle me’
Justin Bieber again called out fans for screaming too much during his concerts, walking off stage mid-set at his gig in Manchester last night. The singer played a show at Manchester Arena on Sunday night (October 23) as part of the UK leg of his ‘Purpose’ world tour. Having previously told his “obnoxious” London crowd to “be quiet and listen when I’m talking” and ordering a previous Manchester audience to “shut up” during his ballads, Bieber told his fans on Sunday: “I appreciate all the support, I appreciate love, I appreciate the kind things. But the screaming in these breaks has got to stop. Please and thank you.” “I don’t think it’s necessary when I’m trying to say something and you guys are screaming,” he added, before dropping his microphone and exiting the stage to boos.

So I’m going to quit talking for the rest of the night and just do the music.” He also said that he “dedicates [his] life to this, to performing, to travelling, to bring smiles to people’s faces,” before adding: “I feel like people are not giving me the same respect back and it hurts a bit.” Justin Bieber explaining why he walked off stage tonight #PurposeTourManchester pic.twitter.com/qdC4CY2M3N — 🦄🦄 (@hannawwh) October 23, 2016 Bieber has made headlines for his random public antics in recent week. Earlier this month, he tried to disguise himself in Amsterdam with a fake goatee and wig. He also surprised a group of London school children by joining in with their game of football.
