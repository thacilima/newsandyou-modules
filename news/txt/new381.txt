The Welsh team had taken the tournament by storm in what was their first appearance in a major finals in 58 years. Having not been expected to make it past the group stage, Chris Coleman's team were just one match away from the final. After last night's semi-final defeat to Portugal, Manic Street Preachers, who recorded Wales' official song for the tournament, wrote on Twitter that the team "have made us so proud", adding "it's been a beautiful dream - from the bottom of our hearts". The Libertines drummer Gary Powell added: "Well done Wales! You've done yourselves proud!", while Jessie Ware said that Wales "had a brilliant and entertaining tournament."
