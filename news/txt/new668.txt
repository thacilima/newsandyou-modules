Kesha will release new music “soon”, says label
Kesha will release new music “soon”, according to her record label. The singer’s last album, ‘Warrior’, came out in 2012. Earlier this year, she collaborated with producer Zedd on the single ‘True Colors’. “Creating a new album takes time, and everyone’s goal is to deliver a high quality album consistent with Kesha’s past releases,” a Sony Music representative told BuzzFeed News. “We hope to share exciting new music with Kesha’s fans soon.” In April, the singer lost her legal bid to be released from her contract with Kemosabe Records, producer Dr Luke’s division of Sony Music . It came after she filed a lawsuit against Dr Luke in 2014 for “mental manipulation, emotional abuse and sexual assault”, all of which he has denied. She and the producer remain locked in a legal battle which has recently seen the singer take steps to prevent him from releasing her medical records. In March, Kesha announced that she was working on new music, telling fans that she’d “been writing all day”. Fans are also speculating that she may have collaborated with Taylor Swift. The singer’s lawyer Daniel Petrocelli told BuzzFeed News: “Kesha has been trying for six months to record and release new music. Only in the last month, after our last court hearing, has any progress been made, but it is hardly enough. Kesha still has received no commitments on promotion, songs, or even a release date.” He added: “We hope things turn around fast. Meanwhile, Kesha intends to continue participating in the creative process in the hopes she can meaningfully return to work.” She is currently midway through a comeback tour of North America and Asia titled ‘Kesha And The Creepies: Fuck the World Tour’.
