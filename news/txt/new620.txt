Tegan And Sara announce UK tour
Tegan And Sara have announced details of UK tour for February 2017. Full dates and ticket details are below. The Canadian twins will be returning to Europe in support of their latest record, ‘Love You To Death’ – read our 5/5 review of the album here. They’ll be calling at London, Manchester, Bristol, Glasgow, Birmingham and Dublin next year, as the ‘Everything Is Awesome’ and ‘Boyfriend’ stars get the year off to a bang by hitting the road. The duo recently voiced their support for Hillary Clinton, with Tegan Quin telling Fader: “I think we’re both pro-Hillary. As Canadians, there’s an enormous amount of what Bernie talks about that resonates with us, but I do feel that Hillary is inevitable. We actually met President Bill Clinton couple years ago in Toronto — we did an event for him. “When he walked up, he shook our hands, gave us hugs, and then he was like, “I’m so excited to meet you guys, my wife and I love Grey’s Anatomy, and ‘Where Does the Good Go’ is our favourite song.” After that, he thanked us for all the work we done in the LGBT community. There’s something to be said for the experience, and something to be said for the Clintons themselves. I’m very intrigued to see what happens. We’ve always picked whoever’s the Democratic candidate. You guys need to get it together down here. We’re watching with deep fascination, and anticipation.” Tegan And Sara’s upcoming UK tour dates are below.
