Dave Grohl’s mum interviews Dr Dre, Haim and Amy Winehouse’s mothers for new book
Dave Grohl’s mother has interviewed many other famous musicians’ mums for a book on what it’s like to raise a child who becomes a rock star. Virginia Hanlon Grohl has interviewed Dr Dre’s mother Virginia Griffin, Amy Winehouse’s mother Janis Whitehouse and the mother of the Haim sisters, Donna Haim, for her book From Cradle To Stage: Stories From The Mothers Who Rocked And Raised Rock Stars. The book is published in April 2017 in the US by Seal Press and features a foreword by Dave Grohl, as well as exclusive childhood photos of Foo Fighters’ singer. A UK publication date has yet to be announced. Other mothers interviewed by Hanlon Grohl over the past two years include Marianne Stipe, whose son is former REM singer Michael Stipe; Hester Diamond (Mike D) and Maroon 5 singer Adam Levine’s mum Patsy Noah. The blurb for the book reads: “As Virginia watched her son’s star rise, she often wondered about the other mothers who raised sons and daughters who became rock stars. Were they as surprised as she was about their children’s fame? Did they worry about their children’s livelihood and wellbeing in an industry fraught with drugs and other dangers? Did they encourage their children’s passions despite the odds against success, or attempt to dissuade them from their grandiose dreams? Do they remind their kids to pack a warm coat when they go on tour?”
