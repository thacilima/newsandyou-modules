Watch Bat For Lashes help a friend propose onstage at End Of The Road Festival
Bat For Lashes helped a festival-goer propose onstage during her performance at End Of The Road this weekend. Singer Natasha Khan passed the microphone over to a friend of her’s who proposed to his partner, joking “I think we’re alone now, which is good”. The woman accepted the proposal, leading to Bat For Lashes performing a rendition of ‘In Your Bed’. Watch in the clip beneath. Bat For Lashes released her latest album ‘The Bride’ in July, the follow-up to 2012’s ‘The Haunted Man’. Earlier this year, Khan bemoaned Instagramming at festivals, saying it had sent them “a bit weird”. Speaking to The Guardian again, she said: “People should try and disconnect from the technology and get into the spirit of things” because festivals should be “an opportunity to forget life back at home, live a magical existence, dress up, have loads of fun, get involved and forget social media.”
