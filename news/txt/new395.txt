The Toronto rapper has had the Number One album and song in the American charts for seven consecutive weeks. 'Views' and 'One Dance' have remained unbeaten on the Billboard 200 and Hot 100 charts respectively. As Hot New Hip-Hop reports, Jackson is the only other male artist to achieve the feat having done so with 'Thriller' and single 'Billie Jean'. Whitney Houston and The Beatles have both had longer runs in the US charts, each having simultaneous Number Ones in the album and singles charts for 12 consecutive weeks. Last week, it was confirmed that 'One Dance' is the longest-running UK Number One single of the millennium and the only single since 2000 to hold the spot for more than ten weeks, as Rihanna's 2007 hit 'Umbrella' did. It has been Number One for 12 weeks. It now ranks fifth ever for duration spent at Number One in the UK, following Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody', Wet Wet Wet's 'Love Is All Around', Bryan Adams' '(Everything I Do) I Do It For You' and Frankie Lane's 1953 song 'I Believe', which spent a record 18 weeks in the top spot.
