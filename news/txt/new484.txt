Lady Gaga: “Mark Ronson gave me a moment to come down from American Horror Story character”
Lady Gaga has opened up about the making of her new album, explaining that Mark Ronson gave her a moment to come down from her character on American Horror Story. Gaga won a Golden Globe for her portrayal of The Countess on American Horror Story: Hotel. There are currently no further details on what role she’ll play in the new series, or if her new character will be a regular character or a cameo. Speaking on Radio 1, Gaga explained, “Mark Ronson gave me a moment to come down from the character because that’s not the character that is making the record.” Back to work! #ahsseason6 #ahs #acting not the countess but…who???

That may sound ridiculous when you see who she is – she’s very in the earth – and that helped me when I got to the studio because I got in that place where I felt really connected to people.” Meanwhile, the singer has confirmed that she has teamed up with Florence Welch on her forthcoming new album. Lady Gaga debuted her new single ‘Perfect Illusion’ this morning (September 9), which was produced by Tame Impala singer Kevin Parker with Mark Ronson and BloodPop, who produced Justin Bieber’s single ‘Sorry’. But she has also collaborated with Beck, Father John Misty and the Florence And The Machine singer on the record.
