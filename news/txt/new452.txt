Watch Drake show off his impressive basketball skills
Drake has showed off his impressive basketball skills, scoring a basket from the halfway line whilst sitting down on two separate occasions. The Toronto rapper first uploaded a clip to Instagram last week which showed him achieve the feat, with Miami Heat later uploading a video to Twitter showing Drake “calling glass” while completing another shot. ‘Calling glass’ is when a player uses the backboard to score.

First attempt… @Drake called glass! pic.twitter.com/0FJF6iYesU — Miami HEAT (@MiamiHEAT) September 1, 2016 Drake has had a busy week – first hinting at any upcoming collaboration with Kanye West and then presenting Rihanna with an award at the MTV VMAs. The rapper declared his love for Rihanna while on stage at the MTV VMAs, saying that he’s been “in love” with the singer for seven years. During his tribute to Rihanna, Drake – dressed in a full tuxedo for the occasion – claimed that he’d be in love with the Barbadian singer since he was 22 years old. “She’s someone I’ve been in love with since I was 22 years old,” the 29-year-old said. “She’s one of my best friends in the world. All my adult life I’ve looked up to her even though she’s younger than me.” Upon accepting the award, Rihanna dedicated the honour and her success to both those closest to her and her fans. “This success is not my own: it’s my family’s, it’s my fans, it’s my country’s, it’s the Caribbean as a whole, it’s women, it’s black women,” she said. “So many people feel like their little piece is such a major part of this puzzle and I have to thank you guys for supporting me over and over.”
