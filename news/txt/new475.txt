Watch Jack White play acoustic medley of ‘Love Is The Truth’ and ‘You’ve Got Her In Your Pocket’
Jack White appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon last night (September 9). The musician performed on the programme to promote his new archival album ‘Acoustic Recordings 1998-2016’, and played an acoustic medley of The White Stripes‘ ‘You’ve Got Her In Your Pocket’ and ‘Love Is The Truth’, the track he wrote for Coca-Cola. Watch the performance below, via Consequence Of Sound. Before getting on stage, White sat down with Fallon for a brief chat. The former White Stripe recounted a story from his flight to New York where an air stewardess recommended he try and get tickets to a taping of The Tonight Show. He also talked guitars with Fallon, saying the guitar he was playing that night was an Army Navy special. “They made it in World War I for soldiers to have in army bases and in trenches, but by the time they finished making it the war was over.” He went on to make fun of the guitar Fallon said he plays, calling it a “beginner’s guitar for children”.
