New York Dolls documentary on the way
Punk legends New York Dolls‘ 2004 Morrissey-instigated regrouping is to be chronicled in a new documentary. ‘New York Doll’ explores late bassist Arthur ‘Killer’ Kane‘s difficult decision to return to the group after a three-decade separation, during which time he made a conversion to Mormonism, reports Pitchfork. Only weeks after rejoining singer David Johansen and guitarist Sylvain Sylvain for the band’s reunion debut at London‘s Royal Festival Hall during the 2004 Meltdown Festival, curated by huge fan Morrissey, the 55-year-old Kane passed away from leukemia. The film features interviews with Kane and his bandmates, as well as friends and fellow musicians as it traces the history of the Dolls from their early 70s inception through to last year’s bout of touring, which carried on afterwards without Kane. ‘New York Doll’, directed by Greg Whitely, was a hit at this year’s Sundance Film Festival, and will debut in theatres in New York and Los Angeles on October 28. There is no confirmed UK release yet. Johansen, Sylvain and the rest of the current New York Dolls line-up (guitarist Steve Conte, bassist Sami Yaffa, drummer Brian Delaney and keyboardist Brian Koonin) are scheduled to enter the studio later this year to record a new album, tentatively set for a spring 2006 release on Roadrunner Records.
