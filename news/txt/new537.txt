Kanye West confirms joint Drake album is happening
Kanye West has confirmed he’s making a joint album with Drake after several weeks of speculation. The project was first rumoured when a billboard appeared in Los Angeles which featured the logos of West and Drake’s respective record labels. Publicly confirming the project for the first time, West told Vogue: “We’re just working on a bunch of music together, having fun going into the studio. We’re working on an album, so there’s some exciting things coming up soon.” The pair have already worked together recently, with Drake co-writing ’30 Hours’ from West’s album ‘The Life Of Pablo’, while West and Jay Z were billed as The Throne when they both appeared on ‘Pop Style’ on Drake’s album ‘Views’. The Throne billing was a reference to West’s previous joint album ‘Watch The Throne’, which he and Jay Z released in 2011. Meanwhile, Travis Scott has revealed that he will be the executive producer on ‘Cruel Winter’, West’s new showcase for his GOOD Music record label. A follow-up to 2012’s ‘Cruel Summer’, it will feature all the acts signed to GOOD Music, including West and Scott. The first taste of ‘Cruel Winter’ was ‘Champions’, a track released in June which featured West and Scott alongside Desiigner, Big Sean, Gucci Mane, 2 Chainz, Yo Gotti and Migos Quavo. Coinciding with the launch of his new fashion range Yeezy 4, West’s Vogue interview also revealed that he and wife Kim Kardashian West want to launch a range of children’s clothes. West said: “I want to do 200 stores in the next year, but that’s just me saying what I want. I’m not saying it’ll definitely happen, but you might as well state out loud what you want, as that’ll put you one step closer to getting it.”
