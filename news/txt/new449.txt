During his tribute to Rihanna, Drake – dressed in a full tuxedo for the occasion – claimed that he’d be in love with the Barbadian singer since he was 22 years old. “She’s someone I’ve been in love with since I was 22 years old,” the 29-year-old said. “She’s one of my best friends in the world. All my adult life I’ve looked up to her even though she’s younger than me.” Upon accepting the award, Rihanna dedicated the honour and her success to both those closest to her and her fans. “This success is not my own: it’s my family’s, it’s my fans, it’s my country’s, it’s the Caribbean as a whole, it’s women, it’s black women,” she said. “So many people feel like their little piece is such a major part of this puzzle and I have to thank you guys for supporting me over and over.”
