The new imagining of the song has been specifically created for an advert for Mexican restaurant chain Chipotle, with Howard and James' vocals playing over an animated clip that tells the love story of two children with competing juice stands that transform into huge fast food companies. The song was originally released by The Backstreet Boys in 1999, and features on second album Millennium. Tomorrow, Alabama Shakes will play one of their biggest UK shows to date when they support Mumford & Sons at their Hyde Park British Summer Time show on a bill that also includes Wolf Alice and Kurt Vile. Earlier this year, the band also achieved massive success at the Grammys, picking up three awards for Best Rock Song, Best Rock Performance and Best Alternative Music Album for 'Sound & Color'. Accepting the award, Brittany Howard said: "When we started, we were in high school. "We did it for fun. We never thought we'd be getting awards or recognition. My heart is beating a mile a minute."
