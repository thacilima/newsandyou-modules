Red Hot Chili Peppers share music video for ‘Go Robot’ inspired by ‘Saturday Night Fever’
Red Hot Chili Peppers have shared a music video for ‘Go Robot’, a track from their latest album ‘The Getaway’. Directed by Tota Lee, the video was inspired by Saturday Night Fever and was shot in the exact same locations used in the film, according to a press release. The clip features frontman Anthony Kiedis covered in white paint, and wearing nothing but a hat, gloves and a codpiece, getting some pizza and then hitting up a discotheque. Last month, the band announced a UK tour following their headline set at Reading and Leeds festival. Red Hot Chili Peppers will return for four nights in December, playing dates in London, Glasgow, Birmingham and Manchester. Kiedis recently suggested collaborating with former One Direction member Harry Styles, offering the singer some of the band’s unused material.
