Frank Ocean’s ‘Blonde’ is now on Spotify
Frank Ocean‘s ‘Blonde’ album is now available to stream on Spotify. ‘Blonde’, one of 2016’s most anticipated releases, was only available to stream on Apple Music when it dropped on August 20. However, as of today (September 9) it is now featured on leading streaming service Spotify too. ‘Blonde’ has also been available to buy on iTunes since it dropped on August 20. On September 1, a report by US business magazine Forbes estimated that Ocean had already made $1m (£750,000) from ‘Blonde’. The report explained that Ocean’s yield from the album is especially high because he released it on his own indie label, Boys Don’t Cry, after fulfilling his contractual obligations to majors Def Jam and Universal by putting out visual album ‘Endless’ beforehand. Sources told Forbes that Ocean could be receiving anywhere between $5 and $7.50 (£3.80 and £5.30) for each copy of ‘Blonde’ purchased on iTunes for $9.99 (£7.50), whereas an artist on a major could expect to receive somewhere between $1.50 and $2.00 (£1.10 and £1.50) per copy.

Ocean finally released his second studio album ‘Blonde’ on August 20, over four years since the arrival of his highly acclaimed debut, ‘channel ORANGE’. ‘Blonde’ has since topped the album charts in both the UK and US. One of Ocean’s collaborators, keyboardist Buddy Ross, has recently spoken about the high level of mystery surrounding the ‘Blonde’ and ‘Endless’ projects.
