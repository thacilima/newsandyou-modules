Snoop Dogg told reporters at the march that the aim was to build dialogue with the police. “The mission is to reintroduce our community to the LAPD... just to get some understanding and dialogue,” he said. “We’re the ones they’re going to be dealing with, we’re the ones that are going to be pulled over. … We’re here on peace.” H.U.N.T the movement !!! #HATEUSNOTTODAY #HUNTUSNOTTODAY A video posted by The Game (@losangelesconfidential) on Jul 8, 2016 at 8:27am PDT Both rappers later condemned the killing of five police officers after a peaceful protest in Dallas yesterday evening (July 7). The Game said: “The cops that died in Dallas weren’t the cops that shot and killed Philando or Alton. As much as Philando and Alton didn’t deserve that, those cops in Dallas didn’t deserve that. And the only thing I could think of was to initiate peace on both sides, so that’s why I’m here.” Speaking to TMZ at the rally, Snoop said: “That’s not the answer, but at the same time there’s just a lot of built up frustration. That’s why there’s needs to be some sort of understanding, so we can bring it to a halt.”
