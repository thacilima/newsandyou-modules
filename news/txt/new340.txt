Watch The Spice Girls post video hinting at a possible reunion tour
The Spice Girls have posted a video hinting at a possible reunion tour. Emma Bunton, Geri Horner and Melanie Brown all appear in the clip which was posted earlier today (July 8), which sees the trio thank their fans on the 20th anniversay of their debut single ‘Wannabe’. “You’ve stood by us for 20 years, and we want to say a big thank you,” Horner says in the video you can watch below. “And we want to celebrate and have a party. And when we do, you’re all invited,” continues Brown – commonly known as Mel B. The text which then appears across the screen suggests further news about the group’s exact plans will be announced in the coming weeks. “We hope to tell you soon what you really really want,” the written message reads – a reference to Wannabe’s lyrics. The video comes a day after reports the girl band are planning a reunion concert in London’s Hyde Park next summer. Music producer Eliot Kennedy, who has frequently worked with The Spice Girls, has also confirmed today that Bunton, Brown and Horner have been working on new music. He told ITV’s Good Morning Britain in a clip you can watch below: “We have been in the studio, with just three of them – Mel B and Geri and Emma – and we had a fantastic couple of days. “We wrote a brilliant song and the energy was exactly like it was 20 years ago, just as enthusiastic, just as much to say, just as much to celebrate. “I think they have something to do with way female artists are perceived in the pop charts nowadays, I think they’ve had a massive effect on pop music and pop culture, so it’s a good time to celebrate.”
