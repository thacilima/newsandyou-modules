Thom Yorke is bored of surprise album releases and is working on new Burial/Four Tet music
Thom Yorke has said he is bored of releasing surprise albums, despite Radiohead pioneering the release plan when they unexpectedly put out ‘In Rainbows’ in 2007. Radiohead have also given little advance warning of their subsequent albums ‘The King Of Limbs’ and ‘A Moon Shaped Pool’. But, in a three-hour Radio 1 show which Yorke co-hosted with Benji B this morning (September 8), Yorke said he was “too old” to continue with surprise release strategies. Asked about the release of his solo album ‘Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes’, which premiered on bit torrent services, Yorke said: “Enough of that now. I’ve entirely had enough of that. No more fuss, just put it out. I’m getting too old for that. It takes away from things a bit, and it’s sometimes frustrating. The energy of trying to do it differently and circumvent the monsters, you’re like…. whatever.” In the show, Yorke also revealed that he’s been making new music with Four Tet’s Kieran Hebden and Burial. The trio released a joint single in 2011, and Yorke said: “I’m hoping to do it again soon. I did another thing, but the vocal was too dark, according to Kieran. For me, that’s ‘Really? Too dark, even for me? OK.’” Yorke confirmed Radiohead will play more shows in 2017, after a break following their final show this year at Austin City Limits festival in Texas in October. Yorke said: “We’ll do some more shows next year, but I don’t know exactly what yet.” He also revealed he wants to revive Atoms For Peace, his band with Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea, Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich, ex-REM drummer Joey Waronker and percussionist Mauro Refosco. The 42-song show saw a new remix by Yorke of MF Doom’s ‘Gazill’ as well as songs by Cocteau Twins, Vince Staples, Zomby, 2 Bad Mice, J Dilla, Death Grips, Scott Walker, Clams Casino and ESG.
