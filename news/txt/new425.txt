Madonna slams Donald Trump’s sons for killing a leopard
Madonna has attacked Donald Trump’s sons for posing for a photo with a wild leopard they killed on a hunting trip. Donald Jr and Eric Trump went on the hunting trip in 2011 in Zimbabwe. The same trip saw the brothers pose with photos of dead elephants, civets, waterbuck and antelope. One photo saw the Trumps pose with a crocodile which was hung from a noose. How Big of. Pussy Do you have to BE to kill this Noble Animal for sport? Just ask Donald Trump Jr and his brother Eric. One more reason to vote for Hilary! https://link.brightcove.com/services/player/?bctid=1660158951001
