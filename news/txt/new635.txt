Metallica fans can hear new song first through the band’s Halloween mask
Metallica are offering fans the opportunity to hear their latest song first via a special Halloween mask. The band have already shared two songs from their upcoming album,’Hardwired…To Self Destruct’: title track ‘Hardwired’ and ‘Moth Into Flame’. A third song from the album, ‘Atlas, Rise!’, will debut next Monday (October 31). However, fans who pick up a free, special limited edition ‘Hardwired… To Self Destruct’ mask at selected independent record shops on Friday (October 28) will get to hear it slightly earlier. The band explained in a post on their website: “Inside of each mask, you’ll find a special access code that will allow you to hear ‘Atlas, Rise!’ 30 minutes prior to its official release on Halloween.” To find out which record shops in the UK, Ireland and North America will be selling the mask, click here. ‘Hardwired…To Self Destruct’ is set for release on November 18. It’s Metallica’s first full album since ‘Death Magnetic’ in 2008. It was recorded with the band’s regular producer Greg Fidelman, but James Hetfield has revealed that at one point the band considered branching out for the album. He recalled: “We said ‘Let’s mix it up. Let’s use someone who doesn’t even know rock and go really sideways.’ But at the end of the day, we know Greg and he knows us.”
