Major Lazer’s Diplo: ‘We’re too old to party too hard’
Major Lazer de-facto leader Diplo has claimed the group are “too old to party too hard”. The ‘Lean On’ hitmakers are interviewed for the cover of this week’s NME, which will be distributed nationwide from Friday (September 2), with the feature available to read on NME.com the same day. During the interview, Diplo – who has also produced recent tracks for Beyoncé and Madonna – estimates that his super-busy schedule led to him taking 300 flights last year. Joined by NME as Major Lazer travel from Luton Airport to London to perform at Lovebox Festival, Diplo says: “We’re too old to party too hard. As you can see, it’s pretty lame. The three of us in a car, drinking water. Every once in a while we might meet a girl, but we usually don’t because we have to go to the airplane.” “We’re pretty normal guys, you know?” Diplo adds. During the interview, Diplo also explains that even flying by private jet has its drawbacks. “When we fly from Burbank to Las Vegas on Southwest Airlines we’ve only had one delay ever,” he says. “On private jets I’ve had, like, 30 delays. What the fuck is the point?”
