Watch Nick Cave And The Bad Seeds perform new track ‘Jesus Alone’
Nick Cave And The Bad Seeds have shared a track from their upcoming new album ‘Skeleton Tree’. The self-produced ‘Skeleton Tree’ is The Bad Seeds’ first album since 2013’s ‘Push The Sky Away’. It features eight songs and will be released on September 9. As previously announced, September 8 sees a series of cinema screenings of director Andrew Dominik’s film ‘One More Time With Feeling’, which documents the making of the album. The screenings will be the first opportunity for fans to hear any of the new album. Ahead of the screenings, Cave and co have released the video for new track ‘Jesus Alone’, the footage of which will feature in the film. It sees the band performing the song live. Filmed in both black-and-white and colour and in 2D and 3D, Dominik’s film was initially intended to be a performance-based film of the recording of ‘Skeleton Tree’. But, following the death of Cave’s 15-year-old son Arthur in November 2015, a statement said: “The film evolved into something much more significant as Dominik delved into the tragic backdrop of the writing and recording of the album.” The film sees interviews with the band accompanied by Cave’s narration and is described as “A true testament to an artist trying to find his way through the darkness.” ‘Skeleton Tree’ was recorded near Cave’s home in Brighton with further sessions at French studio La Frette. There are as yet no shows announced to coincide with ‘Skeleton Tree’. The tracklisting of the ‘Skeleton Tree’ is as follows: ‘Jesus Alone’ ‘Rings Of Saturn’ ‘Girl In Amber’ ‘Magneto’ ‘Anthrocene’ ‘I Need You’ ‘Distant Sky’ ‘Skeleton Tree’
