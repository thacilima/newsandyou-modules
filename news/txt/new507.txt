Listen to rare Oasis demo of ‘Don’t Go Away’
A new demo of the Oasis ‘Be Here Now’ track ‘Don’t Go Away’ has surfaced online. The (Mustique Demo) will feature on the forthcoming deluxe reissue of the 1997 album. The song is a pared down version, with acoustic guitar, shaker, bass and some electric guitar. Notably, Noel Gallagher sings on the track and plays a repeated three-note melody on his electric guitar in the middle of the song rather than going into the bridge where he plays the solo on the original. You can listen to the track below. Noel Gallagher recorded the demo with producer Owen Morris on the Caribbean island of Mustique in early 1996, along with 13 other tracks that will be included on the reissue – which is due out October 7. The reissue also includes a different, acoustic demo of the song on the B-sides disc that runs a minute shorter than the others and finds Noel saying, Where has everyone gone? at the end. The reissue will be available on CD and vinyl, as well as digitally; the LP version will include a download card. The super deluxe version contains the expanded vinyl and CD versions as and it comes with a hardback book with new liner notes, a 12-inch white-label vinyl sampler of the demos and Oasis merchandise. Meanwhile, the Oasis photo exhibition ‘Chasing The Sun: Oasis 1993 – 1997’ will be coming to Manchester from October 14–25 at Old Granada Studios. The exhibition journey documents the band’s rise, via ‘Definitely Maybe’, ‘(What’s The Story) Morning Glory?’ and ‘Be Here Now’ – and many legendary gigs, from London’s 100 Club to Maine Road Stadium, Manchester to their era-defining two-night stand at Knebworth House. In other Oasis news, the band’s forthcoming documentary ‘Supersonic’ is out on October 2. Director Mat Whitecross recently said he is convinced Oasis “will get back together”.
