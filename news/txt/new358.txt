In June, the band had asked for 15 fans to take part in the project, entitled ‘Under The Gun’. Singer Alison Mosshart said she and guitarist Jamie Hince would pay for the tattoos, which were inked at Los Angeles tattoo parlourShamrock Social Club. The tattoos are each a solid black outline, one inch in diameter. Fans were told they could be done anywhere on their body, so long as they were willing to be filmed for the process and were able to travel to Shamrock Social Club. All 13 songs on ‘Ash And Ice’ have their own accompanying symbol, with the other two tattoos being of the volcano and martini glass from the album’s cover. The film now forms the basis for The Kills’ new single ‘Hard Habit To Break’.
