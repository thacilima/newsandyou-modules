Kanye West ‘Fade’ director says video was inspired by Pornhub
The director of Kanye West‘s video for Life of Pablo track ‘Fade’ has said that he took influence from PornHub when it came to shooting the short film. The video is the brainchild of 24-year-old Eli Russell Linetz, who is working with Kanye on a one-year artist residency. But in an extensive interview with The New York Times, Linetz discussed his influences on the project – and says that he “got an email from Kanye superlate one night”, in which the rapper informed him that he was wanted for the video. However, Linetz then went on to discuss his inspirations for the explicit clip, and spoke of how PornHub had influenced it. He said: “I pulled a lot of references from ’70s and ’80s porn, just on Pornhub. That was less about the imagery and more about the texture of the skin, the oiliness.” Lintel also spoke of working with singer Teyana Taylor and her fiancee, basketball player Iman Shumpert, who share a steamy embrace in the video. “Teyana and Iman were just so in love and down for whatever. [Their baby] Junie was crying, they were naked, the sheep were pooping and peeing everywhere”, he said. But they were really game. I had to tell them to be more aggressive in the shower, because they were just so sensual with each other.”
