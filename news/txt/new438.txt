Is Rihanna’s new tattoo dedicated to Drake and does it confirm they’re dating?
Rihanna has reportedly got a new tattoo that was inspired by rumoured boyfriend Drake. Recent reports have suggested that the pair are dating again, having previously had a somewhat on-off relationship in the past. At the weekend, Drake presented Rihanna with an award at the MTV VMAs while declaring his love for her. Then on Wednesday, the pair kissed onstage at the rapper’s gig in Miami. Now TMZ reports that Rihanna has got a camouflage shark tattoo, which allegedly represents a gift that Drake bought her at an aquarium in Toronto. The same stuffed animal later made a cameo in an Instagram photo that the rapper posted of the pair. See both the tattoo and Drake’s original post below.

During his tribute to Rihanna, Drake – dressed in a full tuxedo for the occasion – claimed that he’d be in love with the Barbadian singer since he was 22 years old. “She’s someone I’ve been in love with since I was 22 years old,” the 29-year-old said. “She’s one of my best friends in the world. All my adult life I’ve looked up to her even though she’s younger than me.” Upon accepting the award, Rihanna dedicated the honour and her success to both those closest to her and her fans. “This success is not my own: it’s my family’s, it’s my fans, it’s my country’s, it’s the Caribbean as a whole, it’s women, it’s black women,” she said. “So many people feel like their little piece is such a major part of this puzzle and I have to thank you guys for supporting me over and over.”
