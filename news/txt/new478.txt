Taylor Swift donates $5,000 to fan’s family after they suffer tragic car crash
Taylor Swift has donated $5,000 (£3,800) to the family of a fan who is mourning the loss of her sister in a tragic car accident. Katie Beth Carter, an 18-year-old freshman at Jacksonville State University from Georgia, was involved in a fatal car crash last weekend, Billboard reports. Friends of her family have since set up a crowd-funding campaign to “to show love and support to her parents Jason and Amy Carter, and siblings Jacob and Kimi Carter, by helping to cover medical expenses and the cost of her arrangements”. At the time of writing, it has amassed over $36,000 (£37,000) of its $40,000 (£30,000) target. Among the donations is a $5,000 gift from Swift, who writes on the campaign’s GoFundMe page: “Kimi, No words could express how sorry I am for your loss. I know that you will keep Katie’s memory alive. Please know how much I am thinking of you and saying a prayer for your family. All my love, Taylor.” Kimi Carter thanked the singer for her donation on Instagram, writing next to a screen-grab of Swifts donation: “this…… I cannot believe this at all….. thank you so much, Taylor…. me and my sister are smiling so hard… @taylorswift”.
