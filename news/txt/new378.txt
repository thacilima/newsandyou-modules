The Spice Girls ‘in talks’ to headline Hyde Park next year
The Spice Girls are reportedly in talks to headline Hyde Park next year to mark the 21st anniversary of their debut single ‘Wannabe’. Various members of the group have said that they intended marking the 20th anniversary of their debut this year. However, only Geri Horner, Mel B and Emma Bunton have been willing to mark their formation. None of the band have officially commented on the change of plans, but it’s now thought they hope to persuade Mel C to be part of a concert and TV documentary, after Sporty Spice joined Victoria Beckham in distancing herself from the reunion. While Beckham is said to want no part of the reunion in order to concentrate on her fashion range, The Sun quotes a source as saying that The Spice Girls hope Mel C has had a change of heart. NME understands from another Spice Girls source that a Hyde Park show is a possibility for 2017 as part of the Barclaycard Presents British Summer Time festival. But the discussions are at a very early stage and, given the lack of any reunion activity this year despite constant speculation, the show is far from a certainty. The Spice Girls last tour in 2007 was cut short, and their comeback single ‘Headlines (Friendship Never Ends)’ reached No 11.
