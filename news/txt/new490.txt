Travis Scott’s new merch range includes candles, shot glasses and condoms
Travis Scott has debuted a huge new merch range to accompany his new album. Following the release of second album ‘Birds In The Trap Sing McKnight’ on September 2, the rapper has updated his official store to include bird-themed clothing, candles, cushions, shot glasses, cigarette lighters and more. The rapper is also selling his own signature “Let’s Get It” condom for $5 (£3.80) per contraceptive. Check out the full range here. Pitchfork reports that Scott told fans during a recent festival appearance that anyone who bought the album would be entitled to claim a single piece of merch from the range for free. The rapper’s collaborators on ‘Birds In The Trap Sing McKnight’, his second album, include Kendrick Lamar, who features on a track called ‘Goosebumps’, and The Weeknd, who contributes vocals to a track called ‘Wonderful’. Meanwhile, Outkast’s André 3000 adds vocals to opening song ‘The Ends’. Cassie, Kid Cudi, Bryson Tiller and Young Thug all appear on the album too. ‘Birds In The Trap Sing McKnight’, which was originally due to drop in late-August, is Scott’s follow-up to his 2015 debut album ‘Rodeo’, which peaked at Number Three in the US and yielded the singles ‘3500’ and ‘Antidote’.
