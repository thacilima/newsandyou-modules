St Vincent, Courtney Love and Missy Elliott appear in new Marc Jacobs video – watch
St Vincent, Courtney Love and Missy Elliott all appear in a new music video from leading American fashion designer Marc Jacobs. The video, which is part of the designer’s latest campaign, also features Marilyn Manson, Suicide Squad star Cara Delevingne and Oscar-winning actress Susan Sarandon. It was directed by Hype Williams and features the track ‘Love Honey, Love Heartache (Larry Levan Mix)’ by Man Friday. Speaking to Billboard, which premiered the video, St Vincent likened the Hype Williams shoot to “an acid-trip Fellini film, 8½ or Satyricon“. “Genesis P-Orridge was on one side of me, Susan Sarandon on the other, and all these ­gorgeous, statuesque ­redheads milling round,” St Vincent added. “It was lovely to be in the company of real artists and ­genuine, beautiful freaks.” Explaining why he assembled this seemingly random assortment of musicians and actors for the fashion-led music video, Jacobs said: “In my mind, there is some kind of ­nonlinear connection between all of these people, They’re not one thing. They’re connected because you felt within a certain moment that all these things belong together. There is no rule like, ‘That doesn’t make sense with that.’ It does if you say so.” Watch the video courtesy of Billboard here.
