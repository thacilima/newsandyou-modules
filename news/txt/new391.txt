Watch as Two Door Cinema Club star in disastrous adverts in new video for ‘Are We Ready? (Wreck)’
Two Door Cinema Club are the stars of disastrous adverts in the video for their new single ‘Are We Ready? (Wreck)’. The band wear prosthetics as they feature in clips for airlines, pills and beer. In a statement about the video, frontman Alex Trimble said: “While I was writing this single I discovered this term weltschmertz, the German word for being at odds with the world around you. The fact that it was a fully coined term and related to so many people that have existed and do exist made me feel it was okay to not exist on the same level as everyone else, it was okay to be comfortable doing your own thing. “‘Are We Ready? (Wreck)’ was me… not attacking the world around me but outlining why I don’t really get it and why I don’t fit in with it.” Watch the video below. Speaking to NME about their return, the band described the track as “rebelling against [consumerism]”. Guitarist Sam Halliday said: “The lyrics play on that and hating how the world is going in terms of commercialism and how people are addicted to social media and living on their phones.” Read more from Two Door Cinema Club here.
