Watch Drake lose it after £2.25m of jewellery is stolen from his tourbus
A suspect has been arrested after $3m (£2.25m) of jewellery was stolen from Drake’s tourbus. Drake’s DJ, Future The Prince, had his jewellery stolen following their show at Phoenix’s Talking Stick Resort Arena on Tuesday. Phoenix police say that a local 21-year-old man, Travion King, was arrested with a briefcase full of jewels on the campus of Arizona State University. King has been charged with felony burglary. It’s believed that King worked as a security guard at the Talking Stick Resort Arena, but wasn’t on duty during Drake’s gig. Drake is due to resume touring tomorrow (Septemer 9) with the first of two shows at Los Angeles Staples Center before the tour ends on October 16 with a gig at Newark Prudential Center. He has yet to play any shows in the UK for his ‘Views’ album. The burglary comes as Kanye West has confirmed that he and Drake are making a joint album, five years after West and Jay Z’s joint album ‘Watch The Throne’. Their collaboration follows West and Jay Z appearing as The Throne on ‘Pop Style’ on ‘Views’, with Drake returning the favour by co-writing ’30 Hours’ on West’s album ‘The Life Of Pablo’.
