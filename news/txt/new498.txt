Guns N’ Roses reunion tour has already made £90m
The Guns N’ Roses reunion tour in the US made the band $116.8m (£88m), official figures have revealed. Having played with various incarnations of the band since Slash left, the reunited line-up of Axl Rose, Slash and Duff McKagan played 25 shows this summer for their first gigs together since 1993. The stadium shows were attended by over a million fans, and means Guns N’ Roses have easily had the highest-grossing tour in North America so far this year. Bruce Springsteen And The E-Street Band are in second place, having grossed $33.6m (£25.2m) from just five shows, according to Billboard’s Hot Tours list. Springsteen certainly offered fans value for money, consistently breaking his own record for his longest-ever North American shows, climaxing with a 4hr 4min gig in Philadelphia on Wednesday – though this is still two minutes short of his world record for a 4hr 6min gig in Finland in 2012. Guns N’ Roses resume touring on October 27 with a show in Peru, touring in South America until November 26 followed by shows early in 2017 in Japan, New Zealand and Australia until February 21. There have yet to be any European shows by the reunited line-up, but it’s heavily rumoured Guns N’ Roses will headline Download next summer. The headliners for Download are due to be announced by the end of the year. The festival’s PR refused to comment on the rumour when approached by NME.
