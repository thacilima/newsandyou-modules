Prince’s ‘musical family’ to perform at tribute concert
A tribute concert to be held for Prince will reportedly include musicians “closest” to the star. According to a Minnesota State Arts Board newsletter, the show will feature performances from “members of the iconic Prince Family”, naming Morris Day and the Time, Sheila E, The Revolution and New Power Generation among the acts due to perform. The newsletter added the October 13 show, to be held at the newly built U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, will also feature “prominent pop stars of today on guest vocals.” Lady Gaga and Stevie Wonder are among those rumoured to appear. However, Prince’s longtime attorney L. Londell McMillan told the Associated Press on Wednesday evening that appearances are yet to be confirmed, adding an official announcement will be made after Labor Day (Monday, September 7). Meanwhile, Kiss frontman Gene Simmons recently provoked criticism when he said that Prince’s death was a “choice”. Simmons told US radio station WNOR: “I knew Prince and I knew Bowie. Bowie died from disease. Prince died from drugs, as did Michael Jackson. Drugs killed them, but it was a choice.”
