Prince’s Purple Rain co-star Apollonia Kotero pens emotional tribute to late singer
Actress Apollonia Kotero has paid tribute to Prince for the first time since the death of her Purple Rain co-star. Posting on Facebook, Kotero penned a heartfelt letter in which she opened up about the ‘grief, depression, anger’ that she has experienced ever since the singer’s death was announced in May. She wrote: “I miss you so much, the pain is unbearable, making it hard to breathe, Grief, depression, anger, and loneliness are like those bullies who taunted me in grade school. “They have been relentless. My life has been a vortex of rage and despair. Waves of sadness washing away the pieces of my broken heart. My own personal hell on Earth.” The actress added: “My love for you is great, but my grief is even greater. I promise to stay strong. I know you are with me. Thank you for your guidance and protection. It brings great comfort and solace when I think of your last words to me, “I LOVE U 2”. Last week, Kotero made her first public appearance since Prince’s death, taking part in a Purple Rain Q&A at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Los Angeles. During the panel, she candidly recalled meeting Prince for the first time, prior to the filming of the 1984 film. “I was the last person they saw for the audition”, she said. “Later I learned they were flying me to Minneapolis to meet Prince, who takes me out for a ride in a purple limo. He was very reserved and shy. I’m like Chatty Cathy. The next day we do an audition at First Avenue. “I wore black spandex and a metal mesh blouse. Later there’s a knock at my hotel door and it’s Chick from his security team: ‘The kid likes you. Play it cool.'”
