Mac DeMarco announces massive UK show for 2017
Mac DeMarco has announced a UK live date for 2017. DeMarco was last in the UK in the summer, headlining Brixton Electric as well as playing Glastonbury. He will now return for his biggest London headline show, playing O2 Academy Brixton on May 30. Pre-sale begins on Wednesday (October 26) at 9am via Dice, with general sale tickets following on Friday (October 28) at 9am. DeMarco’s last proper album ‘Salad Days’ came Number Two in NME’s Albums Of 2014 list. He followed it with his ‘Another One’ mini-album in August 2015. DeMarco recently responded to rumours that he would collaborate with MGMT, after he was pictured in the studio with MGMT’s Andrew VanWyngarden. The picture led to speculation that the two acts are recording music together and now, DeMarco could have confirmed that VanWyngarden is working on his forthcoming album. “He lives in the same neighborhood as me, so we’re homies,” he told Spin. “I don’t know, maybe I should leave it as a mystery. I’m not recording on any MGMT albums, just my own record, but who knows?” When asked where his songwriting inspiration stems from, DeMarco responded that “they just pop up” and end up being about his life, or his friends, or his experiences. “And it’s weird because you always have these experiences, and only certain times are you able to manifest these thoughts into a piece of something. So, I don’t understand it. But that’s the beauty of it, though,” he continued.
