Vince Vaughn calls on Oasis to ‘let it go’ and reform
Actor Vince Vaughn has revealed that he’s a Oasis fan and wants the band to “bury the hatchet” and reunite. Vaughn, known for his roles in films like Wedding Crashers and Dodgeball, was attending the Los Angeles premiere of his new movie Hacksaw Ridge when he reportedly spoke about the Britpop band. Vaughn told the Press Association: “I do like a bit of Oasis. I like both [Liam and Noel]”. “I’d like to see them bury the hatchet those two,” he added. “They’ve got to let it go at some point.” Jill Furmanovsky Earlier this month, bookies suspended betting on Oasis reforming in 2017, as talk of the band getting back together continued to gather momentum after the release of the documentary film Supersonic. The Gallagher brothers have had a tense relationship since the Britpop group’s 2009 split, with Liam recently criticising Noel publicly, calling him a potato, a toad, a “scary clown”, describing him as the “Ronnie Corbett of rock” and comparing his brother’s dress sense to that of Gary Barlow. Liam has also compared Noel to Hitler and Oasis to Jesus while calling Noel a “bread head”. Liam recently opened up about his troubled relationship with Noel and revealed the one thing that’s stopping the long-rumoured Oasis reunion.
