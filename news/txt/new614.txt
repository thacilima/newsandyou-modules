Bloc Party share new video for ‘Stunt Queen’
Bloc Party have shared a new video for single ‘Stunt Queen’. It’s the first song that was written and recorded by all four members. The band shared the audio of ‘Stunt Queen’ last month (September 20). It’s their first new material since the release of their fifth album ‘HYMNS’ at the start of 2016. Speaking in a statement, Kele Okereke said: “Stunt Queen has its genesis in an idea that dates back to the Australian tour we did at the start of 2016.” You can watch the video for ‘Stunt Queen’ below. Okereke continued speaking of ‘Stunt Queen’, “It was an idea that we worked on at sound checks and was one of the first ideas to come along after Justin and Louise joined the band. Playing the Hollywood Bowl feels like a significant milestone for the band and we wanted to mark it with a new release,” he said. Bloc Party also announced a huge show for 2017, playing London’s Roundhouse on February 10. Earlier today, they also added a date at Manchester’s Albert Hall.  You can see the full tour dates below.
