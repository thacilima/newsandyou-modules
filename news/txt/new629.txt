John Cale to perform ‘The Velvet Underground & Nico’ in full at UK show
John Cale has announced that he’ll be playing The Velvet Underground‘s classic album ‘The Velvet Underground & Nico’ at three special shows in New York, Paris and Liverpool. See dates and ticket details below. The legendary 1967 album was recorded during Andy Warhol’s Exploding Plastic Inevitable multimedia event tour. With Warhol’s now iconic banana artwork and containing tracks such as ‘Sunday Morning’, ‘I’m Waiting For The Man’, ‘Venus In Furs’, ‘I’ll Be Your Mirror’ and ‘All Tomorrow’s Parties’, it would become one of the most influential albums of all time.

We were an unfriendly brand, dabbling in a world of challenging lyrics and weird sonics that didn’t fit into anyone’s playlist at the time. Remaining ferociously true to our viewpoints, Lou and I never doubted for a moment we could create something to give a voice to things not regularly explored in rock music at the time. “That bizarre combination of four distinctly disparate musicians and a reluctant beauty queen perfectly summed up what it meant to be The Velvet Underground.” In 1966, the band contained the now legendary line-up of Lou Reed, John Cale, Sterling Morrison, Maureen Tucker and Nico. John Cale will perform ‘The Velvet Underground And Nico’ in full at Liverpool Docklands on Friday 26 May. Tickets are on sale from 9am on Friday 18 October.
