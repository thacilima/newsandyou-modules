Downloads on the up
The first half of 2005 has seen the revenue from sales of digital music triple, compared to last year’s figures. Digital sales now make up six per cent of the worldwide music market and, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, are worth around £450 million. “More and more people in a growing number of countries are turing to the new legal ways of downloading music on the internet or on mobile phones,” explained The IFPI‘s John Kennedy to BBC News, though added tacking piracy was still a priority for the music industry. “There is a long way to go – digital and physical piracy remain a big threat to our business in many markets.” The interest in digital formats is linked to the increased use of broadband, 3G mobile phones and portable music players.
