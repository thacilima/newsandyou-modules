Radiohead announced to headline NorthSide Festival
Radiohead‘s 2017 world tour continues to take shape, with the band now confirmed to headline NorthSide Festival in Denmark. After being confirmed to headline Glastonbury 2017 and Poland’s Open’Er Festival, the band’s ‘A Moon Shaped Pool‘ tour will now see them pay their first visit to Denmark in eight years. So ‘honoured’ are the festival to have booked Radiohead, that they’ll be playing for longer than the festival normally allows. “It will be fantastic end to NorthSide 2017 with such a large international act as Radiohead,” said Mayor of Aarhus, Jacob Bundsgaard. “NorthSide in itself and especially combined with Radiohead show is a strong contribution to strengthening the city’s international music profile. So I am not only delighted on behalf of Aarhus as a music city, but also because such large events in the city is helping support the city’s growth, development, and tourism.” He added: “That is also the reason that we in the Municipal Event Forum have given a dispensation so Radiohead can play a little longer than normal between the night of 11 and 12 June 2017 – and in addition, it’s great to see that one of the city’s major music players in this way chooses to contribute to all the experiences we can look forward to next year, when Aarhus becomes the European Capital of Culture for 2017.” NorthSide Festival takes place in Aarhus, Denmark from 9-11 June. Tickets are on sale from 9am on Friday 28 October. Radiohead guitarist Johnny Greenwood is also set to head out on a solo tour, while rhythm guitarist Ed O’Brien will release his debut solo album in 2017. Meanwhile, the band recently made the bonus disc of ‘In Rainbows’ available online for streaming for the first time.
