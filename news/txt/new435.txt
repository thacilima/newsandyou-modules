Paul van Dyk says he was hacked following racist tweet
DJ Paul van Dyk has claimed that his Twitter was hacked after a racist message was posted from his account. A recent tweet from the veteran German producer’s social media page read: “RULE #1: No black people allowed at concerts from this point on. No exceptions.” The tweet was later deleted, with van Dyk clarifying: “Hi guys, yes my account got hacked, the whole team is working to get it back under control. Thanks for your messages.” A representative for the DJ told TMZ that the electronic musician’s website was hacked also and that the perpetrator posted leaked credit card details. Van Dyk’s camp also say that the racist message “contradicts everything Paul’s ever stood for”. See the original hacked tweet and van Dyk’s response below.
