MIA has shared her new collaboration with Zayn Malik. ‘Freedun’ is lifted from the musician’s upcoming LP and sees ex-One Direction member Malik on hook and harmony duties. Hear below, via Annie Mac’s Radio 1 show. MIA’s fifth studio album, ‘A.I.M.’, is due on September 9, and the rapper has previously said it will be last. ‘Go Off’, the album’s lead single, dropped in July. It was recently followed by Diplo collab ‘Bird Song’. MIA recently criticised MTV for not nominating her music video for ‘Borders’ for a VMA. “This is a perfect example of ‘allowed’ voice vs excluded voices,” she wrote on Twitter. Last month (July), the British artist was dropped from the line-up of London’s Afropunk festival following her controversial comments about the Black Lives Matter movement.
