Stevie Nicks discusses recording a new Fleetwood Mac album
Stevie Nicks has shared her thoughts on the possibility of Fleetwood Mac heading back into the recording studio to make a new album. Though the band toured extensively through 2014 and 2015, with Christine McVie returning to the fold for the first time in a decade and a half, they have not released a studio album since 2003’s ‘Say You Will’. During an interview with Billboard, Nicks admitted that the band’s famously tempestuous relationships could have a bearing on whether they make another album together. “Is it possible that Fleetwood Mac might do another record? I can never tell you yes or no, because I don’t know. I honestly don’t know,” she said. “It’s like, do you want to take a chance of going in and setting up in a room for like a year [to record an album] and having a bunch of arguing people? And then not wanting to go on tour because you just spent a year arguing?” “Or do you just go on tour because you know that you have fun up there and you love doing shows?” the musician continued. “And Christine’s only been back for a year and a half.” Nicks, who is preparing to embark on a solo tour of North America next month, added: “So you start to weigh your… ‘Why would you do this, why would you do that?’ And I honestly don’t know. But I never say never… that really is in God’s hands.” READ: Fleetwood Mac’s Buckingham/Nicks years – Rank The Albums
