James Dean Bradfield says he has “no regrets” about Britpop era
Manic Street Preachers‘ James Dean Bradfield has revealed that he has no regrets about the Britpop era after discussing the 20th anniversary of Knebworth. Manic Street Preachers supported Oasis at Knebworth in 1996, along with The Charlatans, The Prodigy, Ocean Colour Scene, Kula Shaker and The Chemical Brothers. Speaking to Digital Spy, Bradfield said he has “no fucking regrets about that time whatsoever.” He continued, “I never understood when bands came out the other end of Britpop and said, ‘Oh, it was such a tiresome time – we got pigeonholed into something. We got coerced into something that wasn’t us’.” “It’s like, yeah, but you were selling 500,000 records you dickwad! And then you never sold anything close to that ever again after Britpop, so stop f**king moaning!” He also spoke of Manic Street Preachers upcoming 13th album, responding to a question about Nicky Wire wanting Morrissey to feature. “If he did ask Moz inevitably there would be a rejection,” he explained. “But that would be beyond the dream really because there’s not many people who sing like him. I don’t want to sound too muso but his choice of notes are just so f**king different to anybody else’s. “His phrasing is different to anybody else’s. His voice would transform any band. But I don’t think we’re ever going to ask, because like I said, it would just be like that school disco moment – you know the girl’s going to say no.”
