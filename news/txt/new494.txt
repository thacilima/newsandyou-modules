Supersonic director: ‘It took The Rolling Stones 15 years to achieve what Oasis did in three’
Mat Whitecross, the director of the forthcoming Oasis movie Supersonic has said the band’s achievements from 1993-96 were unprecedented. The band’s first two records – ‘Definitely Maybe’ and (What’s The Story) Morning Glory? – sold millions within a short period of time which culminated in their Knebworth double header which saw the band play to 250,000 people. “We stopped at Knebworth because what is unique particularly with Oasis is from the moment they signed off the dole in 1993 to the moment they stepped out on stage at Knebworth, that was unheard of,” Whitecross explained. “You don’t do that in two and a half years. The Rolling Stones or Led Zeppelin did that after 15 years. Noel’s theory is it can’t happen again because the music business is so broken up and fractured now. For whatever reason there was this little flash moment where everyone’s eyes were trained on them, the tabloids, they were hanging out with politicians. It was Blair, it was No 10. And then it was over but those two and a half years were gold.” Whitecross also said the band became too big after Knebworth and the magic they had in the first three years was lost. “Those songs are like international anthems now,” he added. “By becoming big you lose it and it’s inevitable. In terms of them taking stock now there’s been enough time for them to get to grips with what they really achieved back then. They were keen to talk about the legacy and were going ‘We did something fucking amazing can we talk about that rather than the bust ups and the nonsense’.” Supersonic is out in UK cinemas on October 2.
