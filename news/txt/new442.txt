Kanye West’s naked ‘Famous’ waxworks on sale for $4 million
The waxworks from Kanye West‘s infamous ‘Famous’ video are up for sale. The controversial video – released in June – opens with a slow pan across a host of celebrities sharing a bed spread, the camera then reveals lifelike wax figurines of George W Bush, Donald Trump, Anna Wintour, Rihanna, Chris Brown, Taylor Swift, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian West, Ray J, Amber Rose, Caitlyn Jenner and Bill Cosby, all depicted sleeping naked. Currently on display at an exhibition in Los Angeles, The New York Times reports that the waxworks are available to be bought for $4 million (£3m), along with the bedspread and a set of 9-volt batteries that make the figurines to look like they’re breathing. West recently explained the theory behind the video, saying that “it’s a comment on fame. It’s not in support or anti any of [the people in the video].” He also spoke about the inclusion in the video of former President Bush, who West notably criticised in 2005 during a live television appeal for relief funds for those affected by Hurricane Katrina in the American south. “Maybe in some alternative universe me and George Bush could have been friends,” he said. “I could have been his O.J. Simpson black friend on the golf course.” West also took to Twitter the morning after the premiere to deliver some rather more uncensored opinions. Among a series of now-deleted tweets, West notably said “Can somebody sue me already” along with the hashtag #I’llwait.
