Trent Reznor and Mogwai score Leonardo DiCaprio climate change film
Trent Reznor and Mogwai have created the score for Leonardo DiCaprio’s climate change film Before the Flood. Set to air on the National Geographic Channel on October 30 in America, the film is directed by actor/director Fisher Stevens and explores Leonardo DiCaprio’s campaign to raise global awareness about the dangers of climate change in his role as a UN Ambassador of Peace. Trent Reznor and Mogwai teamed up with Argentine film composer Gustavo Santaolalla to compose the score. Reznor and Ross also served as both the film’s music supervisors as well as composers. Speaking in a statement, Stevens explained: “The incredible music composed for Before the Flood was one of the most unique collaborations I can think of in scoring a film.” He continued, “Reznor, Ross, Santaolalla, and Mogwai become one voice in capturing the emotion and feeling of Leonardo DiCaprio’s journey to understanding where we stand in terms of climate change, how far gone we are, what can we do about solving this issue and why people are still resistant to understanding how important it is.” The score is set to be released as an album later this year, with screenings of ‘Before the Flood’ taking place in New York and Los Angeles cinemas on October 21.
