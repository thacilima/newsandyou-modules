Little Mix respond to accusations of copying G.R.L. on ‘Shout Out To My Ex’
Little Mix have responded to comparisons between their latest single ‘Shout Out To My Ex’ and US girlband G.R.L.’s 2014 hit ‘Ugly Heart’. Many fans noted the similarities between the two songs when Little Mix debuted ‘Shout Out To My Ex’ on The X Factor earlier this month. G.R.L. then stoked the controversy with a tweet saying “#ShoutOutToUglyHeart”. #ShoutOutToUglyHeart — G.R.L. (@grl) October 16, 2016 Asked about the supposed “copying” controversy during a Belgian radio interview, Little Mix’s Jade Thirlwall said: “Every song is going to have a similar chord sequence, slightly similar lyrics and melodies. It happens all the time. It doesn’t mean that they’re not both incredible songs.” Thirlwall then added: “I think maybe because it was a girl band as well. I just think people like to have something negative to say.” Meanwhile, her bandmate Leigh-Anne Pinnock said that G.R.L.’s song sounds “a lot more country” than their own hit. “I just think, stop trying to hop on the bandwagon,” Perrie Edwards added, before Jesy Nelson said: “Stop trying to get publicity!” Watch Little Mix discuss the similarities below, at around 2 minutes 20 seconds into the interview. Little Mix’s ‘Shout Out To My Ex’ notched up its second week at Number One in the UK on Friday (October 21). Their new album ‘Glory Days’ will follow on November 18.
