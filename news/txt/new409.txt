Watch as Coldplay get scared by tourmate Alessia Cara dressed as a toy bear
Coldplay have been pranked by their support act Alessia Cara. The Canadian singer has been opening for the group on their current US tour and has been filmed playing a trick on the superstars. In a video shared on Coldplay’s Facebook, Chris Martin‘s band can be seen investigating items surrounding their drum riser. One of them appears to be a stuffed bear, but the group get a surprise when they try to pick the toy up. “The “end of term” vibe has definitely started,” Coldplay captioned the video. “After four months on the #AHFODTOUR, opener Alessia Cara leaves the guys a present before soundcheck.” Watch it below, via Billboard. Coldplay paid tribute to Gene Wilder earlier this week by covering ‘Pure Imagination’, which was sung by the actor in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, during their gig in Denver. In the 1971 film, Wilder performs the number as the golden ticket winners first enter the edible world of Wonka’s secretive confectionary factory. The band played an acoustic rendition of Wilder’s most memorable scene at their concert in Denver’s Pepsi Center last night.
