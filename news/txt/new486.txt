Grandaddy sign to Danger Mouse’s label and share two new songs – listen
Grandaddy have shared their first new songs in a decade. The reunited band dropped single and B-side ‘Way We Won’t’ and ‘Clear Your History’ as they announced they have signed a new deal with Danger Mouse’s label, 30th Century Records. Danger Mouse said in a statement: “Grandaddy have always been one of my favourite bands. Their new single is up there with their best work and I’m proud to have them become part of 30th Century Records.” The band had debuted new material during their intimate gig at London’s Oslo last month (August). Speaking to NME around the same time, singer Jason Lyttle said the band’s comeback album was on course to arrive “early next year”. “We’re pretty close to putting a cap on it, there’s just a lot of mixing stuff, a lot of decisions on that to make,” he added. Discussing the sound of the band’s new songs, Lyttle said: “I’ve stayed pretty consistent, and it’s putting the skills I’ve learnt in my studio into practice. I’ve gotten better at the sonic side of it. A lot of old Grandaddy albums have a lot of painful moments with the sonics. I want to unleash some stuff I’ve learned that’s now going to make us sound pretty fucking awesome.” Grandaddy released four albums in their first incarnation from 1997 to 2006, with second album ‘The Sophtware Slump’ in 1999 receiving particular critical acclaim.
