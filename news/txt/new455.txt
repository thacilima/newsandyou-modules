Britney Spears opens up about suffering from anxiety
Britney Spears has opened up about suffering from anxiety in the past in a new interview. The pop singer released her latest album ‘Glory’ last week (August 26), also appearing on James Corden’s Carpool Karaoke to promote the record. Now, speaking in this month’s Marie Claire, Britney described her past struggles with anxiety. “Southern girls can be very hard on themselves because you are expected to be a certain way, you are expected to please people,” Spears said. “And then I moved to Los Angeles when I was very young,” she continued. “I was so under scrutiny. If a hair was out of place, I’d be so anxious. I would be very anxious about so many things.” “I can’t even properly explain how it’s happened, but becoming a mother and being with my boys has made me so much more accepting of myself.” Spears also revealed how her children have been introducing her to new music, especially son Sean Preston. “He is actually pretty cool. We talk a lot about music. He’s introduced me to some great people like Calvin Harris and Skrillex. If you listen, kids can teach you so much.” Britney Spears recently spoke about appearing on Carpool Karaoke. After describing Corden as “incredibly sweet”, Spears told New York City radio station KTU 103.5 FM that shooting Carpool Karaoke was “fun”, but added: “It was a little awkward driving by grocery stores. People walk by and there are like 18 cameras around us. This is just so awkward.” The singer continued: “Sometimes I got on to him [Corden] and said, ‘I don’t want to hear that song again’. They probably didn’t show that part.” Asked which songs she had asked Corden not to play again, Spears replied: “Of course ‘Baby’ and ‘Oops’. Oh my God, and he kept playing them! He put a damn wig on for it. Yeah I totally went along with it.” READ: Why Britney’s ‘Carpool Karaoke’ Is The Most Revealing Ever
