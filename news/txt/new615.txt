Suge Knight sues Dr Dre over hitmen claim
Suge Knight has filed a lawsuit accusing Dr Dre of hiring a hitmen to kill him. Knight claims Dre was responsible for two attempts on his life. He also claims Dre agreed to pay him 30 per cent of his earnings for life, including his share of Apple’s 2014 $3bn (£2.45m) purchase of Dre’s Beats products. Knight alleged that Dre had contacted a man who shot him seven times at Chris Rock’s pre-VMA party in the summer of 2014. Elsewhere in the lawsuit, Knight alleges that Dre paid a man $300,000 to finish the hit in January 2015. He is seeking unspecified damages, punitive and otherwise, for that and a few other claims. But a lawyer for Dre told Rolling Stone: “Given that Dre has had zero interaction with Suge since leaving Death Row Records in 1996, we hope that Suge’s lawyer has lots of malicious prosecution insurance.” Knight is currently in jail awaiting trial for murder. He is accused of running over and killing industry colleague Terry Carter in January 2015 in a car park in Los Angeles. In the case, Knight said he had been defending himself from filmmaker Cle Sloan who allegedly pulled a gun on him. Earlier this month, Dre and Ice Cube were cleared in a wrongful death lawsuit involving Knight and late Hollywood records co-founder Carter. Carter’s family also sued Knight for wrongful death and negligence and named Dre and Ice Cube as defendants. The suit claimed at the time that the rappers hired gang members to provide security for the filming of their NWA biopic Straight Outta Compton, and that it was those gang members who threatened Knight, leading to a panic that caused Carter’s death. But a court ruled that Ice Cube and Dre were not responsible for Carter’s death and have been removed from the lawsuit
